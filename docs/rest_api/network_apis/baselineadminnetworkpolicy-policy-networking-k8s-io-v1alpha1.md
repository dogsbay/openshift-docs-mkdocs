### .spec.ingress { #_specingress }

Description
:   Ingress is the list of Ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods if they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules. A total of 100 Ingress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance. The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single BANP object will be determined by the order in which the rule is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress rules would take the highest precedence. BANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.

| Property             | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lastTransitionTime` | `string`  | lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.                                                                                                   |
| `message`            | `string`  | message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `observedGeneration` | `integer` | observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions\[x\].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.                                           |
| `reason`             | `string`  | reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition’s last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.         |
| `status`             | `string`  | status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `type`               | `string`  | type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt) |

| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |

| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
