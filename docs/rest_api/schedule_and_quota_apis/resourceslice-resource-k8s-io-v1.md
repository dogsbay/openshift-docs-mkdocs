# ResourceSlice \[resource.k8s.io/v1\] { #resourceslice-resource-k8s-io-v1 }

Description
:   ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.

    At the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple &lt;driver name>, &lt;pool name>, &lt;device name>.

    Whenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.

    When allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.

    For resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.

    This is an alpha type and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.

### .spec.sharedCounters { #_specsharedcounters }

Description
:   SharedCounters defines a list of counter sets, each of which has a name and a list of counters available.

    The names of the counter sets must be unique in the ResourcePool.

    Only one of Devices and SharedCounters can be set in a ResourceSlice.

    The maximum number of counter sets is 8.

Type
:   ```
    `array`
    ```

### .spec.sharedCounters\[\] { #_specsharedcounters }

Description
:   CounterSet defines a named set of counters that are available to be used by devices defined in the ResourcePool.

    The counters are not allocatable by themselves, but can be referenced by devices. When a device is allocated, the portion of counters it uses will no longer be available for use by other devices.

Type
:   ```
    `object`
    ```

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |

| `dryRun`          | `string` | When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted.

| `fieldValidation` | `string` | fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered. |
