title: Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation
---

# Setting up the environment for an OpenShift installation { #ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Before you can install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster on bare metal, you must set up your environment for installation.

## Installations RHEL on the provisioner node { #installing-rhel-on-the-provisioner-node_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

With the configuration of the prerequisites complete, the next step is to install RHEL 9.x on the provisioner node. The installer uses the provisioner node as the orchestrator while installing the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

For the purposes of this document, installing RHEL on the provisioner node is out of scope. However, options include but are not limited to using a RHEL Satellite server, PXE, or installation media.

## Preparing the provisioner node for OpenShift Container Platform installation { #preparing-the-provisioner-node-for-openshift-install_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Begin to set up your environment for cluster installation by preparing the provisioner node.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the provisioner node via `ssh`.

2. Create a non-root user (`kni`) and provide that user with `sudo` privileges:

    ```terminal
    # useradd kni
    ```

    ```terminal
    # passwd kni
    ```

    ```terminal
    # echo "kni ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | tee -a /etc/sudoers.d/kni
    ```

    ```terminal
    # chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/kni
    ```

3. Create an `ssh` key for the new user:

    ```terminal
    # su - kni -c "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /home/kni/.ssh/id_rsa -N ''"
    ```

4. Log in as the new user on the provisioner node:

    ```terminal
    # su - kni
    ```

5. Use Red Hat Subscription Manager to register the provisioner node:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo subscription-manager register --username=<user> --password=<pass> --auto-attach
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-9-for-<architecture>-appstream-rpms --enable=rhel-9-for-<architecture>-baseos-rpms
    ```

    !!! note

        For more information about Red Hat Subscription Manager, see [Registering a RHEL system with command-line tools](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_rhel_system_registration/basic-reg-rhel-cli).

6. Install the following packages:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo dnf install -y libvirt qemu-kvm mkisofs python3-devel jq ipmitool
    ```

7. Modify the user to add the `libvirt` group to the newly created user:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo usermod --append --groups libvirt <user>
    ```

8. Restart `firewalld` and enable the `http` service:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

9. Start the modular `libvirt` daemon sockets:

    ```terminal
    $ for drv in qemu interface network nodedev nwfilter secret storage; do sudo systemctl start virt${drv}d{,-ro,-admin}.socket; done
    ```

10. Create the `default` storage pool and start it:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo virsh pool-define-as --name default --type dir --target /var/lib/libvirt/images
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo virsh pool-start default
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo virsh pool-autostart default
    ```

11. Create a `pull-secret.txt` file:

    ```terminal
    $ vim pull-secret.txt
    ```

    In a web browser, navigate to [Install OpenShift on Bare Metal with installer-provisioned infrastructure](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/installer-provisioned). Click **Copy pull secret**. Paste the contents into the `pull-secret.txt` file and save the contents in the `kni` user’s home directory.

## Checking NTP server synchronization { #checking-ntp-sync_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

The OpenShift Container Platform installation program installs the `chrony` Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on the cluster nodes. To complete installation, each node must have access to an NTP time server. You can verify NTP server synchronization by using the `chrony` service.

For disconnected clusters, you must configure the NTP servers on the control plane nodes. For more information see "Configuring NTP for disconnected clusters".

**Prerequisites**

- You installed the `chrony` package on the target node.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the node by using the `ssh` command.

2. View the NTP servers available to the node by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ chronyc sources
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
    ===============================================================================
    ^+ time.cloudflare.com           3  10   377   187   -209us[ -209us] +/-   32ms
    ^+ t1.time.ir2.yahoo.com         2  10   377   185  -4382us[-4382us] +/-   23ms

    ```

3. Use the `ping` command to ensure that the node can access an NTP server, for example:

    ```terminal
    $ ping time.cloudflare.com
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    PING time.cloudflare.com (162.159.200.123) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from time.cloudflare.com (162.159.200.123): icmp_seq=1 ttl=54 time=32.3 ms
    64 bytes from time.cloudflare.com (162.159.200.123): icmp_seq=2 ttl=54 time=30.9 ms
    64 bytes from time.cloudflare.com (162.159.200.123): icmp_seq=3 ttl=54 time=36.7 ms
    ...
    ```

## Configuring networking { #configuring-networking_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Before installation, you must configure networking settings for the provisioner node. Installer-provisioned clusters deploy with a bare-metal bridge and network resources, and an optional provisioning bridge and network resources.

**Figure 1. Configure networking**

![Configure networking](../../../images/210_OpenShift_Baremetal_IPI_Deployment_updates_0122_1.png)

!!! note

    You can also configure networking settings from the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

**Prerequisites**

- You installed the `nmstate` package with the `sudo dnf install -y <package_name>` command. The package includes the `nmstatectl` CLI.

**Procedure**

1. Configure the bare-metal network:

    !!! note

        When configuring the bare-metal network and the secure shell (SSH) connection disconnects, NMState has a rollback mechanism that automatically reverts any configurations. You can also use the `nmstatectl gc` tool to generate configuration files for specified network state files.

    1. For a network using DHCP, run the following command to delete the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` legacy style:

        ```yaml
        $ nmcli con delete "System <baremetal_nic_name>"
        ```

        where:

        `<baremetal_nic_name>`
        :   Replace `<baremetal_nic_name>` with the name of your network interface controller (NIC).

    2. For a network that uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), create an NMState YAML file and specify the bare-metal bridge interface and any physical interfaces in the file:

        ```yaml title="Example bare-metal bridge interface configuration that uses DHCP"
        # ...
        interfaces:
          - name:  <physical_interface_name>
            type: ethernet
            state: up
            ipv4:
              enabled: false
            ipv6:
              enabled: false
          - name: baremetal
            type: linux-bridge
            state: up
            ipv4:
              enabled: true
              dhcp: true
            bridge:
              options:
                stp:
                  enabled: false
              port:
                - name:  <physical_interface_name>
        # ...
        ```

    3. For a network using static IP addressing and no DHCP network, create an NMState YAML file and specify the bare-metal bridge interface details in the file:

        ```yaml title="Example bare-metal bridge interface configuration that uses static IP addressing and no DHCP network"
        # ...
        dns-resolver:
          config:
            server:
              - <dns_ip_address>
        routes:
          config:
            - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
              next-hop-interface: baremetal
              next-hop-address: <gateway_ip>
        interfaces:
          - name: <physical_interface_name>
            type: ethernet
            state: up
            ipv4:
              enabled: false
            ipv6:
              enabled: false
          - name: baremetal
            type: linux-bridge 
            state: up
            ipv4:
              enabled: true
              dhcp: false
              address:
                - ip: <static_ip_address>
                  prefix-length: 24
            bridge:
              options:
                stp:
                  enabled: false
              port:
                - name: <physical_interface_name>
        # ...
        ```

        where:

        `<dns-resolver>`
        :   Defines the DNS server for your bare-metal system.

        `<server>`
        :   Replace `<dns_ip_address>` with the IP address for the DNS server.

        `<type>`
        :   Defines the bridge interface and its static IP configuration.

        `<gateway>`
        :   Replace `<gateway_ip>` with the IP address of the gateway.

        `<name>`
        :   Details the physical interface that you set as the bridge port.

2. Apply the network configuration from the YAML file to the network interfaces for the host by entering the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ nmstatectl apply <path_to_network_yaml>
    ```

3. Back up the network configuration YAML file by entering the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ nmstatectl show > backup-nmstate.yml
    ```

4. Optional: If you are deploying your cluster in a provisioning network, create or edit an NMState YAML file and specify the details in the file.

    !!! note

        The IPv6 address can be any address that does not route through the bare-metal network.

        Ensure that you enabled Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and set UEFI PXE settings for the IPv6 protocol when using IPv6 addressing.

    ```yaml title="Example NMState YAML file for a provisioning network"
    # ...
    interfaces:
      - name: eth1
        type: ethernet
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: false
        ipv6:
          enabled: false
      - name: provisioning
        type: linux-bridge
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: false
          address:
            - ip: 172.22.0.254
              prefix-length: 24
        ipv6:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: false
          address:
            - ip: fd00:1101::1
              prefix-length: 64
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false
          port:
            - name: eth1
    # ...
    ```

5. Optional: Establish an SSH connection into the `provisioner` node by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    # ssh kni@provisioner.<cluster_name>.<domain>
    ```

    where

    `<cluster_name>.<domain>`
    :   Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your cluster and `<domain>` with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your cluster.

6. Verify that the connection bridges have been properly created by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo nmcli con show
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE

## The baremetal-runtimecfg tool { #ipi-install-baremetal-runtimecfg-ip-assignment_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

To prevent incorrect IP address assignments, learn how the `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool determines node IP addresses between your physical network and the Kubernetes control plane.

The `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool uses the following selection logic sequence to determine the IP address for a node:

1. The tool looks at the `NODEIP_HINT` and all API and Ingress VIP addresses.
2. The tool selects an IP address on the same subnet.
3. If no address match is found, the tool looks at the default route and selects an IP address from the interface used by that route.

The `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool uses the following component order of precedence to sort IP addresses for a node:

1. Default route priority
2. Link index
3. IP address family
4. Address subnet contains the default gateway
5. Public versus private
6. Real IPv6 versus IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses
7. Alphanumeric stability

If the wrong IP address is provided because a node has multiple IP addresses on the primary interface, such as `br-ex`, an IP address mismatch is likely the issue because of the following scenarios:

- Specifically for a secondary IP address on the same subnet as the primary IP address. During a node reboot, if both IP addresses are candidates, the `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool might select the secondary IP address based on the sort criteria of the tool.
- During a node reboot, if a primary IP address and a secondary IP address on the same subnet are both candidates, the `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool might select the secondary IP address based on sorting criteria of the tool.
- If the `baremetal-runtimecfg` tool does not set a node IP for the Kubelet service, Kubelet chooses an IP address associated with the default route.

## Creating a manifest object that includes a customized br-ex bridge { #creating-manifest-file-customized-br-ex-bridge_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

By default, OpenShift Container Platform automatically configures the Open vSwitch (OVS) `br-ex` bridge on bare-metal nodes. For advanced networking requirements, you can override this default behavior on bare-metal platforms. To do this, create a `MachineConfig` object that includes an NMState configuration file.

Consider using the customized `br-ex` bridge configuration for any of the following tasks:

- You need to modify the `br-ex` bridge after you installed the cluster.
- You need to modify the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for your cluster.
- You need to update DNS values.
- You need to modify attributes for a different bond interface. Examples include MIImon (Media Independent Interface Monitor), bonding mode or Quality of Service (QoS).
- You need to enable Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) to discover and troubleshoot switch connectivity.

!!! note

    Use the default OVS `br-ex` bridge for standard environments.

    Use the default OVS `br-ex` bridge mechanism for single network interface controller (NIC) environments with default network settings.

After you install Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) and the system reboots, the Machine Config Operator injects Ignition configuration files into each node. This operation ensures that each node receives the `br-ex` bridge network configuration. To prevent configuration conflicts, the default OVS `br-ex` bridge mechanism is disabled.

!!! warning

    The following list of interface names are reserved and you cannot use the names with NMstate configurations:

    - `br-ext`
    - `br-int`
    - `br-local`
    - `br-nexthop`
    - `br0`
    - `ext-vxlan`
    - `ext`
    - `genev_sys_*`
    - `int`
    - `k8s-*`
    - `ovn-k8s-*`
    - `patch-br-*`
    - `tun0`
    - `vxlan_sys_*`

**Prerequisites**

- Optional: You have installed the [`nmstatectl`](https://nmstate.io/user/quick_guide.html) CLI tool to validate your NMState configuration.

**Procedure**

1. Create an NMState configuration file and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration in the file:

    ```yaml title="Example of an NMState configuration for a customized br-ex bridge network"
    interfaces:
    - name: enp2s0
      type: ethernet
      state: up
      mtu: 9000
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
    - name: br-ex
      type: ovs-bridge
      state: up
      ipv4:
        enabled: false
        dhcp: false
      ipv6:
        enabled: false
        dhcp: false
      bridge:
        options:
          mcast-snooping-enable: true
        port:
        - name: enp2s0
        - name: br-ex
    - name: br-ex
      type: ovs-interface
      state: up
      copy-mac-from: enp2s0
      mtu: 9000
      ipv4:
        enabled: true
        dhcp: true
        auto-route-metric: 48
      ipv6:
        enabled: true
        dhcp: true
        auto-route-metric: 48
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `interfaces.name`
    :   Specifies the name of the interface.

    `interfaces.type`
    :   Specifies the type of ethernet.

    `interfaces.state`
    :   Specifies the requested state for the interface after creation.

    `mtu`
    :   To ensure network stability and performance, you must explicitly declare the MTU in the manifest for every interface. Do not rely on automatic MTU configuration. The MTU configured on a bridge port or VLAN-tagged interface must not exceed the maximum frame size supported by the attached physical medium. A mismatch causes packet fragmentation or connectivity loss.

    `ipv4.enabled`
    :   Disables IPv4 and IPv6 in this example.

    `port.name`
    :   Specifies the node NIC to which the bridge attaches.

    `auto-route-metric`
    :   Sets the parameter to `48` to ensure the `br-ex` default route always has the highest precedence (lowest metric). This configuration prevents routing conflicts with any other interfaces that are automatically configured by the `NetworkManager` service.

2. Use the `cat` command to base64-encode the contents of the NMState configuration:

    ```terminal
    $ cat <nmstate_configuration>.yml | base64
    ```

    where:

    `<nmstate_configuration>`
    :   Replace `<nmstate_configuration>` with the name of your NMState resource YAML file.

3. Create a `MachineConfig` manifest file and define a customized `br-ex` bridge network configuration analogous to the following example. The installation program automatically applies the updates from the `MachineConfig` object to your cluster.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
      name: 10-br-ex-worker
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          files:
          - contents:
              source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,<base64_encoded_nmstate_configuration>
            mode: 0644
            overwrite: true
            path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/worker-0.yml
          - contents:
              source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,<base64_encoded_nmstate_configuration>
            mode: 0644
            overwrite: true
            path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/worker-1.yml
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `metadata.name`
    :   Specifies the name of the policy.

    `contents.source`
    :   Writes the encoded base64 information to the specified path.

    `path`
    :   For each node in your cluster, specify the hostname path to your node and the base-64 encoded Ignition configuration file data for the machine type. The `worker` role is the default role for nodes in your cluster. You must use the `.yml` extension for configuration files. For example, use `$(hostname -s).yml` when specifying the short hostname path for each node or all nodes in the `MachineConfig` manifest file. You can apply a single global configuration to all nodes in your cluster by using the `/etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml` configuration file. In this case, you do not need to specify the short hostname path for each node, such as `/etc/nmstate/openshift/<node_hostname>.yml`. For example:

    ```yaml title="Example /etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml configuration file"
    # ...
          - contents:
              source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,<base64_encoded_nmstate_configuration>
            mode: 0644
            overwrite: true
            path: /etc/nmstate/openshift/cluster.yml
    # ...
    ```

### Scaling each machine set to compute nodes { #creating-scaling-machine-sets-compute-nodes-networking_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

To scale each machine set to compute nodes, you must apply a customized `br-ex` bridge configuration to all compute nodes in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You must then edit your `MachineConfig` custom resource (CR) and modify its roles. 

Additionally, you must create a `BareMetalHost` CR that defines information for your bare-metal machine, such as hostname, credentials, and your other required parameters. After you configure these resources, you must scale machine sets, so that the machine sets can apply the resource configuration to each compute node and reboot the nodes.

**Prerequisites**

- You created a `MachineConfig` manifest object that includes a customized `br-ex` bridge configuration.

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `MachineConfig` CR by entering the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc edit mc <machineconfig_custom_resource_name>
    ```

2. Add each compute node configuration to the CR, so that the CR can manage roles for each defined compute node in your cluster.

3. Create a `Secret` object named `extraworker-secret` that has a minimal static IP configuration.

4. Apply the `extraworker-secret` secret to each node in your cluster by entering the following command. This step provides each compute node access to the Ignition config file.

    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f ./extraworker-secret.yaml
    ```

5. Create a `BareMetalHost` resource and specify the network secret in the `preprovisioningNetworkDataName` parameter:

    ```yaml title="Example BareMetalHost resource with an attached network secret"
    apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
    kind: BareMetalHost
    spec:
    # ...
      preprovisioningNetworkDataName: ostest-extraworker-0-network-config-secret
    # ...
    ```

6. To manage the `BareMetalHost` object within the `openshift-machine-api` namespace of your cluster, change to the namespace by entering the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc project openshift-machine-api
    ```

7. Get the machine sets:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get machinesets
    ```

8. Scale each machine set by entering the following command. You must run this command for each machine set.

    ```terminal
    $ oc scale machineset <machineset_name> --replicas=<n>
    ```

    where:

    `<machineset_name>`
    :   Specifies the name of the machine set.

    `<n>`
    :   Specifies the number of compute nodes.

## Establishing communication between subnets { #ipi-install-establishing-communication-between-subnets_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

In a typical OpenShift Container Platform cluster setup, all nodes, including the control plane and compute nodes, reside in the same network. However, for edge computing scenarios, it can be beneficial to locate compute nodes closer to the edge. 

This often involves using different network segments or subnets for the remote nodes than the subnet used by the control plane and local compute nodes. Such a setup can reduce latency for the edge and allow for enhanced scalability.

Before installing OpenShift Container Platform, you must configure the network properly to ensure that the edge subnets containing the remote nodes can reach the subnet containing the control plane nodes and receive traffic from the control plane too.

!!! warning

    During cluster installation, assign permanent IP addresses to nodes in the network configuration of the `install-config.yaml` configuration file. If you do not do this, nodes might get assigned a temporary IP address that can impact how traffic reaches the nodes. For example, if a node has a temporary IP address assigned to it and you configured a bonded interface for a node, the bonded interface might receive a different IP address.

You can run control plane nodes in the same subnet or multiple subnets by configuring a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer. With a multiple subnet environment, you can reduce the risk of your OpenShift Container Platform cluster from failing because of a hardware failure or a network outage. For more information, see "Services for a user-managed load balancer" and "Configuring a user-managed load balancer".

Running control plane nodes in a multiple subnet environment requires completion of the following key tasks:

- Configuring a user-managed load balancer instead of the default load balancer by specifying `UserManaged` in the `loadBalancer.type` parameter of the `install-config.yaml` file.
- Configuring a user-managed load balancer address in the `ingressVIPs` and `apiVIPs` parameters of the `install-config.yaml` file.
- Adding the multiple subnet Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) and the user-managed load balancer IP addresses to the `networking.machineNetworks` parameter in the `install-config.yaml` file.

!!! note

    Deploying a cluster with multiple subnets requires using virtual media, such as `redfish-virtualmedia` and `idrac-virtualmedia`.

This procedure details the network configuration required to allow the remote compute nodes in the second subnet to communicate effectively with the control plane nodes in the first subnet and to allow the control plane nodes in the first subnet to communicate effectively with the remote compute nodes in the second subnet.

In this procedure, the cluster spans two subnets:

- The first subnet (`10.0.0.0`) contains the control plane and local compute nodes.
- The second subnet (`192.168.0.0`) contains the edge compute nodes.

**Procedure**

1. Configure the first subnet to communicate with the second subnet:

    1. Log in as `root` to a control plane node by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ sudo su -
        ```

    2. Get the name of the network interface by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli dev status
        ```

    3. Add a route to the second subnet (`192.168.0.0`) via the gateway by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli connection modify <interface_name> +ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 via <gateway>"
        ```

        Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name. Replace `<gateway>` with the IP address of the actual gateway.

        ```terminal title="Example"
        # nmcli connection modify eth0 +ipv4.routes "192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.1"
        ```

    4. Apply the changes by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli connection up <interface_name>
        ```

        Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name.

    5. Verify the routing table to ensure the route has been added successfully:

        ```terminal
        # ip route
        ```

    6. Repeat the previous steps for each control plane node in the first subnet.

        !!! note

            Adjust the commands to match your actual interface names and gateway.

2. Configure the second subnet to communicate with the first subnet:

    1. Log in as `root` to a remote compute node by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ sudo su -
        ```

    2. Get the name of the network interface by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli dev status
        ```

    3. Add a route to the first subnet (`10.0.0.0`) via the gateway by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli connection modify <interface_name> +ipv4.routes "10.0.0.0/24 via <gateway>"
        ```

        Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name. Replace `<gateway>` with the IP address of the actual gateway.

        ```terminal title="Example"
        # nmcli connection modify eth0 +ipv4.routes "10.0.0.0/24 via 10.0.0.1"
        ```

    4. Apply the changes by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # nmcli connection up <interface_name>
        ```

        Replace `<interface_name>` with the interface name.

    5. Verify the routing table to ensure the route has been added successfully by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        # ip route
        ```

    6. Repeat the previous steps for each compute node in the second subnet.

        !!! note

            Adjust the commands to match your actual interface names and gateway.

3. After you have configured the networks, test the connectivity to ensure the remote nodes can reach the control plane nodes and the control plane nodes can reach the remote nodes.

    1. From the control plane nodes in the first subnet, ping a remote node in the second subnet by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ ping <remote_node_ip_address>
        ```

        If the ping is successful, it means the control plane nodes in the first subnet can reach the remote nodes in the second subnet. If you do not receive a response, review the network configurations and repeat the procedure for the node.

    2. From the remote nodes in the second subnet, ping a control plane node in the first subnet by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ ping <control_plane_node_ip_address>
        ```

        If the ping is successful, it means the remote compute nodes in the second subnet can reach the control plane in the first subnet. If you do not receive a response, review the network configurations and repeat the procedure for the node.

    ```

## Creating an RHCOS images cache { #ipi-install-creating-an-rhcos-images-cache_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

To employ image caching, you must download the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image used by the bootstrap VM to provision the cluster nodes. Image caching is optional, but it is especially useful when running the installation program on a network with limited bandwidth.

!!! note

    The installation program no longer needs the `clusterOSImage` RHCOS image because the correct image is in the release payload.

If you are running the installation program on a network with limited bandwidth and the RHCOS images download takes more than 15 to 20 minutes, the installation program will timeout. Caching images on a web server will help in such scenarios.

!!! warning

    If you enable TLS for the HTTPD server, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your OpenShift Container Platform hub and spoke clusters and the HTTPD server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.

Install a container that contains the images.

**Procedure**

1. Install `podman`:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo dnf install -y podman
    ```

2. Open firewall port `8080` to be used for RHCOS image caching:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --zone=public --permanent
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

3. Create a directory to store the `bootstraposimage`:

    ```terminal
    $ mkdir /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache
    ```

4. Set the appropriate SELinux context for the newly created directory:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/home/kni/rhcos_image_cache(/.*)?"
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo restorecon -Rv /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache/
    ```

5. Get the URI for the RHCOS image that the installation program will deploy on the bootstrap VM:

    ```terminal
    $ export RHCOS_QEMU_URI=$(/usr/local/bin/openshift-baremetal-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r --arg ARCH "$(arch)" '.architectures[$ARCH].artifacts.qemu.formats["qcow2.gz"].disk.location')
    ```

6. Get the name of the image that the installation program will deploy on the bootstrap VM:

    ```terminal
    $ export RHCOS_QEMU_NAME=${RHCOS_QEMU_URI##*/}
    ```

7. Get the SHA hash for the RHCOS image that will be deployed on the bootstrap VM:

    ```terminal
    $ export RHCOS_QEMU_UNCOMPRESSED_SHA256=$(/usr/local/bin/openshift-baremetal-install coreos print-stream-json | jq -r --arg ARCH "$(arch)" '.architectures[$ARCH].artifacts.qemu.formats["qcow2.gz"].disk["uncompressed-sha256"]')
    ```

8. Download the image and place it in the `/home/kni/rhcos_image_cache` directory:

    ```terminal
    $ curl -L ${RHCOS_QEMU_URI} -o /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache/${RHCOS_QEMU_NAME}
    ```

9. Confirm SELinux type is of `httpd_sys_content_t` for the new file:

    ```terminal
    $ ls -Z /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache
    ```

10. Create the pod:

    ```terminal
    $ podman run -d --name rhcos_image_cache \
    -v /home/kni/rhcos_image_cache:/var/www/html \
    -p 8080:8080/tcp \
    registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/httpd-24
    ```

    This command creates a caching webserver with the name `rhcos_image_cache`. This pod serves the `bootstrapOSImage` image in the `install-config.yaml` file for deployment.

11. Generate the `bootstrapOSImage` configuration:

    ```terminal
    $ export BAREMETAL_IP=$(ip addr show dev baremetal | awk '/inet /{print $2}' | cut -d"/" -f1)
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ export BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE="http://${BAREMETAL_IP}:8080/${RHCOS_QEMU_NAME}?sha256=${RHCOS_QEMU_UNCOMPRESSED_SHA256}"
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ echo "    bootstrapOSImage=${BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE}"
    ```

12. Add the required configuration to the `install-config.yaml` file under `platform.baremetal`:

    ```terminal
    platform:
      baremetal:
        bootstrapOSImage: <bootstrap_os_image> 
    ```

    Replace `<bootstrap_os_image>` with the value of `$BOOTSTRAP_OS_IMAGE`.

    See the "Configuring the install-config.yaml file" section for additional details.

## Services for a user-managed load balancer { #nw-osp-services-external-load-balancer_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

!!! warning

    Configuring a user-managed load balancer depends on your vendor’s load balancer.

    The information and examples in this section are for guideline purposes only. Consult the vendor documentation for more specific information about the vendor’s load balancer.

Red Hat supports the following services for a user-managed load balancer:

- Ingress Controller
- OpenShift API
- OpenShift MachineConfig API

You can choose whether you want to configure one or all of these services for a user-managed load balancer. Configuring only the Ingress Controller service is a common configuration option. To better understand each service, view the following diagrams:

**Figure 2. Example network workflow that shows an Ingress Controller operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment**

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an Ingress Controller operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.](../../../images/external-load-balancer-default.png)

**Figure 3. Example network workflow that shows an OpenShift API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment**

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.](../../../images/external-load-balancer-openshift-api.png)

**Figure 4. Example network workflow that shows an OpenShift `MachineConfig` API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment**

![An image that shows an example network workflow of an OpenShift `MachineConfig` API operating in an OpenShift Container Platform environment.](../../../images/external-load-balancer-machine-config-api.png)

The following configuration options are supported for user-managed load balancers:

- Use a node selector to map the Ingress Controller to a specific set of nodes. You must assign a static IP address to each node in this set, or configure each node to receive the same IP address from the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Infrastructure nodes commonly receive this type of configuration.

- Target all IP addresses on a subnet. This configuration can reduce the effort required to maintain the load balancer, because you can create and destroy nodes within those networks without reconfiguring the load balancer targets. If you deploy your ingress pods by using a machine set on a smaller network, such as a `/27` or `/28`, you can simplify your load balancer targets.

    !!! tip

        You can list all IP addresses that exist in a network by checking the machine config pool’s resources.

Before you configure a user-managed load balancer for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, consider the following information:

- For a front-end IP address, you can use the same IP address for the front-end IP address, the Ingress Controller load balancer, and API load balancer. Check the vendor’s documentation for this capability.

- For a back-end IP address, ensure that an IP address for an OpenShift Container Platform control plane node does not change during the lifetime of the user-managed load balancer. You can achieve this by completing one of the following actions:

    - Assign a static IP address to each control plane node.
    - Configure each node to receive the same IP address from the DHCP every time the node requests a DHCP lease. Depending on the vendor, the DHCP lease might be in the form of an IP reservation or a static DHCP assignment.

- Manually define each node that runs the Ingress Controller in the user-managed load balancer for the Ingress Controller back-end service. For example, if the Ingress Controller moves to an undefined node, a connection outage can occur.

### Configuring a user-managed load balancer { #nw-osp-configuring-external-load-balancer_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use a user-managed load balancer in place of the default load balancer.

!!! warning

    Before you configure a user-managed load balancer, ensure that you read the "Services for a user-managed load balancer" section.

Read the following prerequisites that apply to the service that you want to configure for your user-managed load balancer.

!!! note

    MetalLB, which runs on a cluster, functions as a user-managed load balancer.

**Prerequisites**

The following list details OpenShift API prerequisites:

- You defined a front-end IP address.

- TCP ports 6443 and 22623 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer. Check the following items:

    - Port 6443 provides access to the OpenShift API service.
    - Port 22623 can provide ignition startup configurations to nodes.

- The front-end IP address and port 6443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

- The front-end IP address and port 22623 are reachable only by OpenShift Container Platform nodes.

- The load balancer backend can communicate with OpenShift Container Platform control plane nodes on port 6443 and 22623.

The following list details Ingress Controller prerequisites:

- You defined a front-end IP address.
- TCP port 443 and port 80 are exposed on the front-end IP address of your load balancer.
- The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all users of your system with a location external to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- The front-end IP address, port 80 and port 443 are reachable by all nodes that operate in your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- The load balancer backend can communicate with OpenShift Container Platform nodes that run the Ingress Controller on ports 80, 443, and 1936.

The following list details prerequisites for health check URL specifications:

You can configure most load balancers by setting health check URLs that determine if a service is available or unavailable. OpenShift Container Platform provides these health checks for the OpenShift API, Machine Configuration API, and Ingress Controller backend services.

The following example shows a Kubernetes API health check specification for a backend service:

```terminal
Path: HTTPS:6443/readyz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
```

The following example shows a Machine Config API health check specification for a backend service:

```terminal
Path: HTTPS:22623/healthz
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 10
Interval: 10
```

The following example shows a Ingress Controller health check specification for a backend service:

```terminal
Path: HTTP:1936/healthz/ready
Healthy threshold: 2
Unhealthy threshold: 2
Timeout: 5
Interval: 10
```

**Procedure**

1. Configure the HAProxy Ingress Controller, so that you can enable access to the cluster from your load balancer on ports 6443, 22623, 443, and 80. Depending on your needs, you can specify the IP address of a single subnet or IP addresses from multiple subnets in your HAProxy configuration.

2. Use the `curl` CLI command to verify that the user-managed load balancer and its resources are operational:

    1. Verify that the cluster machine configuration API is accessible to the Kubernetes API server resource, by running the following command and observing the response:

        ```terminal
        $ curl https://<loadbalancer_ip_address>:6443/version --insecure
        ```

        If the configuration is correct, you receive a JSON object in response:

        ```json
        {
          "major": "1",
          "minor": "11+",
          "gitVersion": "v1.11.0+ad103ed",
          "gitCommit": "ad103ed",
          "gitTreeState": "clean",
          "buildDate": "2019-01-09T06:44:10Z",
          "goVersion": "go1.10.3",
          "compiler": "gc",
          "platform": "linux/amd64"
        }
        ```

    2. Verify that the cluster machine configuration API is accessible to the Machine config server resource, by running the following command and observing the output:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -v https://<loadbalancer_ip_address>:22623/healthz --insecure
        ```

        If the configuration is correct, the output from the command shows the following response:

        ```terminal
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Length: 0
        ```

    3. Verify that the controller is accessible to the Ingress Controller resource on port 80, by running the following command and observing the output:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -I -L -H "Host: console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>" http://<load_balancer_front_end_IP_address>
        ```

        If the configuration is correct, the output from the command shows the following response:

        ```terminal
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        content-length: 0
        location: https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp4.private.opequon.net/
        cache-control: no-cache
        ```

    4. Verify that the controller is accessible to the Ingress Controller resource on port 443, by running the following command and observing the output:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -I -L --insecure --resolve console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:443:<Load Balancer Front End IP Address> https://console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
        ```

        If the configuration is correct, the output from the command shows the following response:

        ```terminal
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

        cache-control: private
        ```

3. Configure the DNS records for your cluster to target the front-end IP addresses of the user-managed load balancer. You must update records to your DNS server for the cluster API and applications over the load balancer. The following examples shows modified DNS records:

    ```dns
    <load_balancer_ip_address>  A  api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
    A record pointing to Load Balancer Front End
    ```

    ```dns
    <load_balancer_ip_address>   A apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>
    A record pointing to Load Balancer Front End
    ```

    !!! warning

        DNS propagation might take some time for each DNS record to become available. Ensure that each DNS record propagates before validating each record.

4. For your OpenShift Container Platform cluster to use the user-managed load balancer, you must specify the following configuration in your cluster’s `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    # ...
    platform:
      bare-metal:
        loadBalancer:
          type: <loadBalancer_type>
        apiVIPs:
        - <api_ip>
        ingressVIPs:
        - <ingress_ip>
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `<loadBalancer_type>`
    :   Specifies the load balancer type. Set to `UserManaged` to specify a user-managed load balancer for your cluster. The parameter defaults to `OpenShiftManagedDefault`, which denotes the default internal load balancer. For services defined in an `openshift-kni-infra` namespace, a user-managed load balancer can deploy the `coredns` service to pods in your cluster but ignores `keepalived` and `haproxy` services.

    `<api_ip>`
    :   Specifies the user-managed load balancer’s public IP address for the Kubernetes API. Mandatory parameter.

    `<ingress_ip>`
    :   Specifies the user-managed load balancer’s public IP address for ingress traffic. Mandatory parameter.

**Verification**

1. Use the `curl` CLI command to verify that the user-managed load balancer and DNS record configuration are operational:

    1. Verify that you can access the cluster API, by running the following command and observing the output:

        ```terminal
        $ curl https://api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>:6443/version --insecure
        ```

        If the configuration is correct, you receive a JSON object in response:

## Setting the cluster node hostnames through DHCP { #ipi-install-setting-cluster-node-hostnames-dhcp_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) machines, `NetworkManager` sets the hostnames. By default, DHCP provides the hostnames to `NetworkManager`, which is the recommended method. 

The `NetworkManager` gets the hostnames through a reverse DNS lookup in the following cases:

- If DHCP does not provide the hostnames
- If you use kernel arguments to set the hostnames
- If you use another method to set the hostnames

Reverse DNS lookup occurs after the network has been initialized on a node, and can increase the time it takes `NetworkManager` to set the hostname. Other system services can start before `NetworkManager` setting the hostname, which can cause those services to use a default hostname such as `localhost`.

!!! tip

    You can avoid the delay in setting hostnames by using DHCP to provide the hostname for each cluster node. Additionally, setting the hostnames through DHCP can bypass manual DNS record name configuration errors in environments that have a DNS split-horizon implementation.

## Local arbiter node configuration prerequisites { #local-arbiter-node-config-prerequisites_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

To retain high availability (HA) while reducing infrastructure costs for your cluster, you can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster with two control plane nodes and one local arbiter node.

A local arbiter node is a lower-cost, co-located machine that participates in control plane quorum decisions. Unlike a standard control plane node, the arbiter node does not run the full set of control plane services. You can use this configuration to maintain HA in your cluster with only two fully provisioned control plane nodes instead of three.

!!! warning

    You can configure a local arbiter node only. Remote arbiter nodes are not supported.

To deploy a cluster with two control plane nodes and one local arbiter node, you must define the following nodes in the `install-config.yaml` file:

- 2 control plane nodes
- 1 arbiter node

The arbiter node must meet the following minimum system requirements:

- 2 threads
- 8 GB of RAM
- 50 GB of SSD or equivalent storage

The arbiter node must be located in a network environment with an end-to-end latency of less than 500 milliseconds, including disk I/O. In high-latency environments, you might need to apply the `etcd` slow profile.

The control plane nodes must meet the following minimum system requirements:

- 4 threads
- 16 GB of RAM
- 120 GB of SSD or equivalent storage

Additionally, the control plane nodes must also have enough storage for the workload.

## Configuring a local arbiter node by using installer-provisioned infrastructure { #ipi-install-config-local-arbiter-node_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

To retain high availability (HA) while reducing infrastructure costs for your cluster, you can configure an OpenShift Container Platform cluster with two control plane nodes and one local arbiter node.

**Prerequisites**

- You have downloaded OpenShift CLI (`oc`) and the installation program.
- You have logged into the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file to define the arbiter node alongside control plane nodes.

    ```yaml title="Example install-config.yaml configuration for deploying an arbiter node"
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: devcluster.openshift.com
    compute:
      - architecture: amd64
        hyperthreading: Enabled
        name: worker
        platform: {}
        replicas: 0
    arbiter:
      architecture: amd64
      hyperthreading: Enabled
      replicas: 1
      name: arbiter
      platform:
        baremetal: {}
    controlPlane:
      architecture: amd64
      hyperthreading: Enabled
      name: master
      platform:
        baremetal: {}
      replicas: 2
    platform:
      baremetal:
    # ...
        hosts:
          - name: cluster-master-0
            role: master
    # ...
          - name: cluster-master-1
            role: master
            ...
          - name: cluster-arbiter-0
            role: arbiter
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `arbiter`
    :   Specifies the arbiter machine pool. You must configure this field to deploy a cluster with an arbiter node.

    `arbiter.replicas`
    :   Specifies the value for the `arbiter.replicas` parameter. Set the `replicas` field to `1` for the arbiter pool. You cannot set this field to a value that is greater than 1.

    `arbiter.name`
    :   Specifies a name for the arbiter machine pool.

    `controlPlane`
    :   Specifies the control plane machine pool.

    `controlPlane.replicas`
    :   Specifies the value for the `controlPlane.replicas` parameter. When an arbiter pool is defined, two control plane replicas are valid.

2. Save the modified `install-config.yaml` file.

## Configuring the install-config.yaml file { #configuring-the-install-config-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

The `install-config.yaml` file requires some additional details. Most of the information teaches the installation program and the resulting cluster enough about the available hardware that it is able to fully manage it.

!!! note

    The installation program no longer needs the `clusterOSImage` RHCOS image because the correct image is in the release payload.

**Procedure**

1. Configure `install-config.yaml`. Change the appropriate variables to match the environment, including `pullSecret` and `sshKey`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: <domain>
    metadata:
      name: <cluster_name>

    pullSecret: '<pull_secret>'
    sshKey: '<ssh_pub_key>'
    ```

    where:

    `compute.replicas`
    :   Specifies the value for the `compute.replicas` parameter. Scale the compute machines based on the number of compute nodes that are part of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Valid options for the `replicas` value are `0` and integers greater than or equal to `2`. Set the number of replicas to `0` to deploy a three-node cluster, which contains only three control plane machines. A three-node cluster is a smaller, more resource-efficient cluster that can be used for testing, development, and production. You cannot install the cluster with only one compute node.

    `platform.baremetal.additionalNTPServers`
    :   Specifies the optional list of additional NTP server domain names or IP addresses to add to each host configuration when the cluster host clocks are out of synchronization.

    `platform.baremetal.bootstrapExternalStaticIP`
    :   Specifies the value for the `bootstrapExternalStaticIP` parameter. When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticIP` configuration setting to specify the static IP address of the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare metal network.

    `platform.baremetal.bootstrapExternalStaticGateway`
    :   Specifies the value for the `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway` parameter. When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticGateway` configuration setting to specify the gateway IP address for the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare metal network.

    `platform.baremetal.bootstrapExternalStaticDNS`
    :   Specifies the value for the `bootstrapExternalStaticDNS` parameter. When deploying a cluster with static IP addresses, you must set the `bootstrapExternalStaticDNS` configuration setting to specify the DNS address for the bootstrap VM when there is no DHCP server on the bare metal network.

    `platform.baremetal.hosts.bmc.address`
    :   Specifies the value for the `platform.baremetal.hosts.bmc.address` parameter. See the BMC addressing sections for more options.

    `platform.baremetal.hosts.rootDeviceHints.deviceName`
    :   Specifies the value for the `platform.baremetal.hosts.rootDeviceHints.deviceName` parameter. To set the path to the installation disk drive, enter the kernel name of the disk. For example, `/dev/sda`.

    !!! warning

        Because the disk discovery order is not guaranteed, the kernel name of the disk can change across booting options for machines with multiple disks. For example, `/dev/sda` becomes `/dev/sdb` and vice versa. To avoid this issue, you must use persistent disk attributes, such as the disk World Wide Name (WWN) or `/dev/disk/by-path/`. It is recommended to use the `/dev/disk/by-path/<device_path>` link to the storage location. To use the disk WWN, replace the `deviceName` parameter with the `wwnWithExtension` parameter. Depending on the parameter that you use, enter either of the following values:

        - The disk name. For example, `/dev/sda`, or `/dev/disk/by-path/`.
        - The disk WWN. For example, `"0x64cd98f04fde100024684cf3034da5c2"`. Ensure that you enter the disk WWN value within quotes so that it is used as a string value and not a hexadecimal value.

        Failure to meet these requirements for the `rootDeviceHints` parameter might result in the following error:

        ```text
        ironic-inspector inspection failed: No disks satisfied root device hints
        ```

    !!! note

        Before OpenShift Container Platform 4.12, the cluster installation program only accepted an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address for the `apiVIP` and `ingressVIP` configuration settings. In OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 and later, these configuration settings are deprecated. Instead, use a list format in the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings to specify IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, or both IP address formats.

2. Create a directory to store the cluster configuration:

    ```terminal
    $ mkdir ~/clusterconfigs
    ```

3. Copy the `install-config.yaml` file to the new directory:

    ```terminal
    $ cp install-config.yaml ~/clusterconfigs
    ```

4. Ensure all bare metal nodes are powered off prior to installing the OpenShift Container Platform cluster:

    ```terminal
    $ ipmitool -I lanplus -U <user> -P <password> -H <management-server-ip> power off
    ```

5. Remove old bootstrap resources if any are left over from a previous deployment attempt:

    ```bash
    for i in $(sudo virsh list | tail -n +3 | grep bootstrap | awk {'print $2'});
    do
      sudo virsh destroy $i;
      sudo virsh undefine $i;
      sudo virsh vol-delete $i --pool $i;
      sudo virsh vol-delete $i.ign --pool $i;
      sudo virsh pool-destroy $i;
      sudo virsh pool-undefine $i;
    done
    ```

### Additional installation configuration parameters { #additional-install-config-parameters_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Some parameters, such as the cluster domain name, are required in the `install-config.yaml` file when installing a cluster on bare metal. Others, such as the provisioning network CIDR, are optional.

### BMC addressing { #bmc-addressing_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) and the Redfish network boot protocol are two common methods of addressing a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).

!!! note

    To deploy clusters with virtualized control planes running on OpenShift Virtualization VMs instead of physical servers, you can use KubeVirt Redfish to expose VMs as Redfish endpoints. You can use this approach to deploy virtualized control planes with installer-provisioned infrastructure. See "Understanding virtualized control planes" for more information.

Most vendors support Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) addressing with the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI). IPMI does not encrypt communications. It is suitable for use within a data center over a secured or dedicated management network. Check with your vendor to see if they support Redfish network boot.

Redfish delivers simple and secure management for converged, hybrid IT and the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC). Redfish is human readable and machine capable, and leverages common internet and web services standards to expose information directly to the modern tool chain. If your hardware does not support Redfish network boot, use IPMI.

You can change the BMC address during installation while the node is in the `Registering` state. If you need to change the BMC address after the node leaves the `Registering` state, you must disconnect the node from Ironic, edit the `BareMetalHost` resource, and reconnect the node to Ironic. See the *Editing a BareMetalHost resource* section for details.

#### IPMI { #_ipmi }

IPMI uses the `ipmi://<out_of_band_ip>:<port>` address format, which defaults to port `623` if not specified. The following example demonstrates an IPMI configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: ipmi://<out_of_band_ip>
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
```

!!! warning

    When PXE booting using IPMI for BMC addressing, you must use a provisioning network. It is not possible to PXE boot hosts without a provisioning network. If you deploy without a provisioning network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`. See "Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO" in the "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" section or "Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC" in the "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" section for additional details.

#### Redfish network boot { #_redfish_network_boot }

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable TLS. The installation program requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
```

It is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses. On OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and earlier, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
```

On OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and later, you can include `disableCertificateVerification: False` in the `bmc` configuration to verify self-signed certificates when used in conjunction with the `bmcCACert` parameter. The following example demonstrates the configuration of a BMC CA certificate.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    bmcCACert:
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ......
      ......
      ......
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ......
      ......
      ......
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ......
      ......
      ......
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
     hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: False
```

### Verifying support for Redfish APIs { #verifying-support-for-redfish-apis_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

When installing using the Redfish API, the installation program calls several Redfish endpoints on the baseboard management controller (BMC) when using installer-provisioned infrastructure on bare metal. If you use Redfish, ensure that your BMC supports all of the Redfish APIs before installation.

**Procedure**

1. Set the IP address or hostname and ID of the BMC:

    1. Set the IP address or hostname of the BMC by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ export SERVER=<ip_address>
        ```

        Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address or hostname of the BMC.

    2. Set the ID of the system by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ export SystemID=<system_id>
        ```

        Replace `<system_id>` with the system ID. For example, `System.Embedded.1` or `1`. See the following vendor-specific BMC sections for details.

2. Check the list of Redfish APIs:

    1. Check `power on` support by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X POST -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H'Accept: application/json' -d '{"ResetType": "On"}' https://$SERVER/redfish/v1/Systems/$SystemID/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset
        ```

    2. Check `power off` support by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X POST -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H'Accept: application/json' -d '{"ResetType": "ForceOff"}' https://$SERVER/redfish/v1/Systems/$SystemID/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset
        ```

    3. Check the temporary boot implementation that uses `pxe` by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "If-Match: <ETAG>"  https://$Server/redfish/v1/Systems/$SystemID/ -d '{"Boot": {"BootSourceOverrideTarget": "pxe", "BootSourceOverrideEnabled": "Once"}}
        ```

    4. Check the status of setting the firmware boot mode that uses `Legacy` or `UEFI` by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "If-Match: <ETAG>"  https://$Server/redfish/v1/Systems/$SystemID/ -d '{"Boot": {"BootSourceOverrideMode":"UEFI"}}
        ```

3. Check the list of Redfish virtual media APIs:

    1. Check the ability to set the temporary boot device that uses `cd` or `dvd` by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "If-Match: <ETAG>" https://$Server/redfish/v1/Systems/$SystemID/ -d '{"Boot": {"BootSourceOverrideTarget": "cd", "BootSourceOverrideEnabled": "Once"}}'
        ```

    2. Virtual media might use `POST` or `PATCH`, depending on your hardware. Check the ability to mount virtual media by running one of the following commands:

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://$Server/redfish/v1/Managers/$ManagerID/VirtualMedia/$VmediaId -d '{"Image": "https://example.com/test.iso", "TransferProtocolType": "HTTPS", "UserName": "", "Password":""}'
        ```

        ```terminal
        $ curl -u $USER:$PASS -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "If-Match: <ETAG>" https://$Server/redfish/v1/Managers/$ManagerID/VirtualMedia/$VmediaId -d '{"Image": "https://example.com/test.iso", "TransferProtocolType": "HTTPS", "UserName": "", "Password":""}'
        ```

        !!! note

            The `PowerOn` and `PowerOff` commands for Redfish APIs are the same for the Redfish virtual media APIs. In some hardware, you might only find the `VirtualMedia` resource under `Systems/$SystemID` instead of `Managers/$ManagerID`. For the `VirtualMedia` resource, the `UserName` and `Password` fields are optional.

        !!! warning

            `HTTPS` and `HTTP` are the only supported parameter types for `TransferProtocolTypes`.

### BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC { #bmc-addressing-for-dell-idrac_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure the `bmc` parameter to use the iDRAC virtual media protocol, the Redfish network boot protocol, or the IPMI protocol to connect to a Dell iDRAC system.

The `address` configuration setting for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network. The `username` configuration for each `bmc` entry must specify a user with `Administrator` privileges.

#### BMC address formats for Dell iDRAC { #_bmc_address_formats_for_dell_idrac }

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


!!! warning

    Use `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. `redfish-virtualmedia` will not work on Dell hardware. Dell’s `idrac-virtualmedia` uses the Redfish standard with Dell’s OEM extensions.

See the following sections for additional details.

#### Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC { #_redfish_virtual_media_for_dell_idrac }

For Redfish virtual media on Dell servers, use `idrac-virtualmedia://` in the `address` setting. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work.

!!! note

    Use `idrac-virtualmedia://` as the protocol for Redfish virtual media. Using `redfish-virtualmedia://` will not work on Dell hardware, because the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol corresponds to the `idrac` hardware type and the Redfish protocol in Ironic. Dell’s `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol uses the Redfish standard with Dell’s OEM extensions. Ironic also supports the `idrac` type with the WSMAN protocol. Therefore, you must specify `idrac-virtualmedia://` to avoid unexpected behavior when electing to use Redfish with virtual media on Dell hardware.

The following example demonstrates using iDRAC virtual media within the  `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: idrac-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
```

It is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses. For OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and earlier, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. For OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and later, you can include `disableCertificateVerification: False` when used in conjunction with the `bmcCACert` configuration setting.

!!! note

    Ensure the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes have **AutoAttach** enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: **Configuration** → **Virtual Media** → **Attach Mode** → **AutoAttach**.

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: idrac-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
```

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: False` configuration parameter along with the `bmcCACert` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    bmcCACert:
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ......

      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: idrac-virtualmedia://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: False
```

#### Redfish network boot for iDRAC { #_redfish_network_boot_for_idrac }

To enable Redfish, use `redfish://` or `redfish+http://` to disable transport layer security (TLS). The installation program requires both the hostname or the IP address and the path to the system ID. The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
```

It is recommended to have a certificate of authority for the out-of-band management addresses. For OpenShift Container Platform 4.16 and earlier, you must include `disableCertificateVerification: True` in the `bmc` configuration if using self-signed certificates. For OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 and later, you can include `disableCertificateVerification: False` when used in conjunction with the `bmcCACert` configuration setting.

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: True` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1
          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: True
```

The following example demonstrates a Redfish configuration by using the `disableCertificateVerification: False` configuration parameter along with the `bmcCACert` configuration parameter within the `install-config.yaml` file.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    bmcCACert:

          username: <user>
          password: <password>
          disableCertificateVerification: False
```

!!! note

    There is a known issue on Dell iDRAC 9 with firmware version `04.40.00.00` and all releases up to including the `5.xx` series for installer-provisioned installations on bare metal deployments. The virtual console plugin defaults to eHTML5, an enhanced version of HTML5, which causes problems with the **InsertVirtualMedia** workflow. Set the plugin to use HTML5 to avoid this issue. The menu path is **Configuration** → **Virtual console** → **Plug-in Type** → **HTML5** .

    Ensure the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes have **AutoAttach** enabled through the iDRAC console. The menu path is: **Configuration** → **Virtual Media** → **Attach Mode** → **AutoAttach** .

### BMC addressing for HPE iLO { #bmc-addressing-for-hpe-ilo_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can connect to an HPE iLO system using the Redfish virtual media protocol, the Redfish network boot protocol, or the IPMI protocol.

The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

### BMC addressing for Fujitsu iRMC { #bmc-addressing-for-fujitsu-irmc_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can connect to a Fujitsu iRMC system using the iRMC protocol or the IPMI protocol. The `address` field for each `bmc` entry is a URL for connecting to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes, including the type of controller in the URL scheme and its location on the network.

| Protocol | Address Format            |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| iRMC     | `irmc://<out-of-band-ip>` |
| IPMI     | `ipmi://<out-of-band-ip>` |

### Root device hints { #root-device-hints_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

The `rootDeviceHints` parameter enables the installer to provision the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) image to a particular device. The installer examines the devices in the order it discovers them, and compares the discovered values with the hint values. The installer uses the first discovered device that matches the hint value. The configuration can combine multiple hints, but a device must match all hints for the installer to select it.

### Setting proxy settings { #ipi-install-setting-proxy-settings-within-install-config_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster while using a proxy by editing the `install-config.yaml` file.

**Procedure**

1. Add proxy values under the `proxy` key mapping:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: <domain>
    proxy:
      httpProxy: http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:PORT
      httpsProxy: https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@proxy.example.com:PORT
      noProxy: <WILDCARD_OF_DOMAIN>,<PROVISIONING_NETWORK/CIDR>,<BMC_ADDRESS_RANGE/CIDR>
    ```

    The following is an example of `noProxy` with values.

    ```yaml
    noProxy: .example.com,172.22.0.0/24,10.10.0.0/24
    ```

2. With a proxy enabled, set the appropriate values of the proxy in the corresponding key/value pair.

    Key considerations:

    - If the proxy does not have an HTTPS proxy, change the value of `httpsProxy` from `https://` to `http://`.
    - If the cluster uses a provisioning network, include it in the `noProxy` setting, otherwise the installation program fails.
    - Set all of the proxy settings as environment variables within the provisioner node. For example, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.

### Deploying with no provisioning network { #modifying-install-config-for-no-provisioning-network_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can deploy an OpenShift Container Platform cluster without a `provisioning` network, by changing the `install-config.yaml` file.

**Procedure**

- Make the following changes to the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    platform:
      baremetal:
        apiVIPs:
          - <api_VIP>
        ingressVIPs:
          - <ingress_VIP>
        provisioningNetwork: "Disabled"
    ```

    Add the `provisioningNetwork` configuration setting, if needed, and set it to `Disabled`.

    !!! warning

        The `provisioning` network is required for PXE booting. If you deploy without a `provisioning` network, you must use a virtual media BMC addressing option such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`. See "Redfish virtual media for HPE iLO" in the "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" section or "Redfish virtual media for Dell iDRAC" in the "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" section for additional details.

### Deploying IP addressing with dual-stack networking { #modifying-install-config-for-dual-stack-network_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

When deploying IP addressing with dual-stack networking for the bootstrap virtual machine (VM), the bootstrap VM functions with a single IP version.

!!! note

    The following examples are for DHCP. DHCP-based dual stack clusters can deploy with one IPv4 and one IPv6 virtual IP address (VIP) each from Day 1.

    Deploying a cluster with static IP addresses involves configuring IP addresses for the bootstrap VM, API, and ingress VIPs. Configuring dual-stack with a static IP set in `install-config` requires one VIP each for API and ingress. Add secondary VIPs after deployment.

For dual-stack networking in OpenShift Container Platform clusters, you can configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes, edit the `machineNetwork`, `clusterNetwork`, and `serviceNetwork` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file. Each setting must have two CIDR entries each. For a cluster with the IPv4 family as the primary address family, specify the IPv4 setting first. For a cluster with the IPv6 family as the primary address family, specify the IPv6 setting first.

```yaml
machineNetwork:
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet }}
- cidr: {{ extcidrnet6 }}
clusterNetwork:
- cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
  hostPrefix: 23
- cidr: fd02::/48
  hostPrefix: 64
serviceNetwork:
- 172.30.0.0/16
- fd03::/112
```

!!! warning

    On a bare metal platform, if you specified an NMState configuration in the `networkConfig` section of your `install-config.yaml` file, add `interfaces.wait-ip: ipv4+ipv6` to the NMState YAML file to resolve an issue that prevents your cluster from deploying on a dual-stack network.

    ```yaml title="Example NMState YAML configuration file that includes the wait-ip parameter"
    networkConfig:
      nmstate:
        interfaces:
        - name: <interface_name>
    # ...
          wait-ip: ipv4+ipv6
    # ...
    ```

To provide an interface to the cluster for applications that use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, configure IPv4 and IPv6 virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the Ingress VIP and API VIP services. To configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints, edit the `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings in the `install-config.yaml` file . The `apiVIPs` and `ingressVIPs` configuration settings use a list format. The order of the list indicates the primary and secondary VIP address for each service.

```yaml
platform:
  baremetal:
    apiVIPs:
      - <api_ipv4>
      - <api_ipv6>
    ingressVIPs:
      - <wildcard_ipv4>
      - <wildcard_ipv6>
```

!!! note

    For a cluster with dual-stack networking configuration, you must assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to the same interface.

### Configuring host network interfaces { #configuring-host-network-interfaces-in-the-install-config-yaml-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to use NMState to configure host network interfaces.

The most common use case for this functionality is to specify a static IP address on the bare-metal network, but you can also configure other networks such as a storage network. This functionality supports other NMState features such as VLAN, VXLAN, bridges, bonds, routes, MTU, and DNS resolver settings.

!!! warning

    Do not set the unsupported `rotate` option in the DNS resolver settings for your cluster. The option disrupts the DNS resolution function of the internal API.

**Prerequisites**

- Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
- Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

!!! warning

    If you use a provisioning network, configure it by using the `dnsmasq` tool in Ironic. To do a fully static deployment, you must use virtual media.

**Procedure**

1. Optional: Consider testing the NMState syntax with `nmstatectl gc` before including the syntax in the `install-config.yaml` file, because the installation program does not check the NMState YAML syntax.

    !!! note

        Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes by using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.

    1. Create an NMState YAML file:

        ```yaml
        interfaces:
        - name: <nic1_name>
          type: ethernet
          state: up
          ipv4:
            address:
            - ip: <ip_address>
              prefix-length: 24
            enabled: true
        dns-resolver:
          config:
            server:
            - <dns_ip_address>
        routes:
          config:
          - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
            next-hop-address: <next_hop_ip_address>
            next-hop-interface: <next_hop_nic1_name>
        ```

        Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.

    2. Test the configuration file by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file>
        ```

        Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the configuration file name.

2. Use the `networkConfig` configuration setting by adding the NMState configuration to hosts within the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
        hosts:
          - name: openshift-master-0
            role: master
            bmc:
              address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
              username: <user>
              password: <password>
              disableCertificateVerification: null

    ```

    For `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces`, add the NMState YAML syntax to configure the host interfaces.

    Replace `<nic1_name>`, `<ip_address>`, `<dns_ip_address>`, `<next_hop_ip_address>` and `<next_hop_nic1_name>` with appropriate values.

    !!! warning

        After deploying the cluster, you cannot modify the `networkConfig` configuration setting of `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.

### Configuring host network interfaces for subnets { #ipi-install-configuring-host-network-interfaces-for-subnets_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

For edge computing scenarios, it can be beneficial to locate compute nodes closer to the edge. To locate remote nodes in subnets, you might use different network segments or subnets for the remote nodes than you used for the control plane subnet and local compute nodes. 

You can reduce latency for the edge and allow for enhanced scalability by setting up subnets for edge computing scenarios.

!!! warning

    When using the default load balancer, `OpenShiftManagedDefault` and adding remote nodes to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, all control plane nodes must run in the same subnet. When using more than one subnet, you can also configure the Ingress VIP to run on the control plane nodes by using a manifest. See "Configuring network components to run on the control plane" for details.

If you have established different network segments or subnets for remote nodes as described in the section on "Establishing communication between subnets", you must specify the subnets in the `machineNetwork` configuration setting if the workers are using static IP addresses, bonds or other advanced networking. When setting the node IP address in the `networkConfig` parameter for each remote node, you must also specify the gateway and the DNS server for the subnet containing the control plane nodes when using static IP addresses. This ensures that the remote nodes can reach the subnet containing the control plane and that they can receive network traffic from the control plane.

!!! note

    Deploying a cluster with multiple subnets requires using virtual media, such as `redfish-virtualmedia` or `idrac-virtualmedia`, because remote nodes cannot access the local provisioning network.

**Procedure**

1. Add the subnets to the `machineNetwork` in the `install-config.yaml` file when using static IP addresses:

    ```yaml
    networking:
      machineNetwork:
      - cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      - cidr: 192.168.0.0/24
      networkType: OVNKubernetes
    ```

2. Add the gateway and DNS configuration to the `networkConfig` parameter of each edge compute node using NMState syntax when using a static IP address or advanced networking such as bonds:

    ```yaml
    networkConfig:
      interfaces:
      - name: <interface_name>
        type: ethernet
        state: up
        ipv4:
          enabled: true
          dhcp: false
          address:
          - ip: <node_ip>
            prefix-length: 24
          gateway: <gateway_ip>
      dns-resolver:
        config:
          server:
          - <dns_ip>
    ```

    where:

    `networkConfig.interfaces.name`
    :   Specifies the interface name.

    `networkConfig.interfaces.ipv4.address.ip`
    :   Specifies the IP address of the node.

    `networkConfig.interfaces.ipv4.gateway`
    :   Specifies the IP address of the gateway.

    `networkConfig.dns-resolver.cofig.server`
    :   Specifies the IP address of the DNS server.

### Configuring address generation modes for SLAAC in dual-stack networks { #ipi-install-modifying-install-config-for-slaac-dual-stack-network_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

For dual-stack clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), you must specify a global value for the `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` network setting. You can set this value using NMState to configure the RAM disk and the cluster configuration files. If you do not configure a consistent `ipv6.addr-gen-mode` in these locations, IPv6 address mismatches can occur between CSR resources and `BareMetalHost` resources in the cluster.

**Prerequisites**

- Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

**Procedure**

1. Optional: Consider testing the NMState YAML syntax with the `nmstatectl gc` command before including it in the `install-config.yaml` file because the installation program will not check the NMState YAML syntax.

    1. Create an NMState YAML file:

        ```yaml
        interfaces:
        - name: eth0
          ipv6:
            addr-gen-mode: <address_mode>
        ```

        Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.

    2. Test the configuration file by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ nmstatectl gc <nmstate_yaml_file>
        ```

        Replace `<nmstate_yaml_file>` with the name of the test configuration file.

2. Add the NMState configuration to the `hosts.networkConfig` section within the install-config.yaml file:

    ```yaml
        hosts:
          - name: openshift-master-0
            role: master
            bmc:
              address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
              username: <user>
              password: <password>
              disableCertificateVerification: null
            bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
            bootMode: UEFI
            rootDeviceHints:
              deviceName: "/dev/sda"
            networkConfig:
              interfaces:
              - name: eth0
                ipv6:
                  addr-gen-mode: <address_mode>
    ...
    ```

    Replace `<address_mode>` with the type of address generation mode required for IPv6 addresses in the cluster. Valid values are `eui64`, `stable-privacy`, or `random`.

### Configuring host network interfaces for dual-port NIC { #configuring-host-dual-network-interfaces-in-the-install-config-yaml-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Before installation, you can set the `networkConfig` configuration setting in the `install-config.yaml` file to configure host network interfaces by using NMState to support dual-port network interface controller (NIC).

OpenShift Virtualization only supports the following bond modes:

- mode=1 active-backup
- mode=2 balance-xor
- mode=4 802.3ad

**Prerequisites**

- Configure a `PTR` DNS record with a valid hostname for each node with a static IP address.
- Install the NMState CLI (`nmstate`).

!!! note

    Errors in the YAML syntax might result in a failure to apply the network configuration. Additionally, maintaining the validated YAML syntax is useful when applying changes by using Kubernetes NMState after deployment or when expanding the cluster.

**Procedure**

1. Add the NMState configuration to the `networkConfig` field to hosts within the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
        hosts:
          - name: worker-0
            role: worker
            bmc:
              address: redfish+http://<out_of_band_ip>/redfish/v1/Systems/
              username: <user>
              password: <password>
              disableCertificateVerification: false
            bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
            bootMode: UEFI
            networkConfig:

                    next-hop-interface: bond0
                    table-id: 254
    ```

    where:

    `hosts.networkconfig`
    :   Specifies the value for the `hosts.networkconfig` parameter. The `networkConfig` field has information about the network configuration of the host, with subfields including `interfaces`, `dns-resolver`, and `routes`.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces`
    :   Specifies an array of network interfaces defined for the host.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.name`
    :   Specifies the name of the interface.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.type`
    :   Specifies the type of interface. This example creates a ethernet interface.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.ipv4.dhcp`
    :   Specifies the value for the `dhcp` parameter. Set this to `false` to disable DHCP for the physical function (PF) if it is not strictly required.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.ethernet.sr-iov.total-vfs`
    :   Specifies the value for the `sr-iov.total-vfs` parameter. Set to the number of SR-IOV virtual functions (VFs) to instantiate.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.state`
    :   Specifies the value for the `state` parameter. Set this to `up`.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.ipv4.enabled`
    :   Specifies the value for the `ipv4.enabled` parameter. Set this to `false` to disable IPv4 addressing for the VF attached to the bond.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.min-tx-rate`
    :   Specifies the value for the `min-tx-rate` parameter. Sets a minimum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 100 Mbps. \*   This value must be less than or equal to the maximum transmission rate. \*   Intel NICs do not support the `min-tx-rate` parameter. For more information, see [**BZ#1772847**](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772847).

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.max-tx-rate`
    :   Specifies the value for the `max-tx-rate` parameter. Sets a maximum transmission rate, in Mbps, for the VF. This sample value sets a rate of 200 Mbps.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.link-aggregation.mode`
    :   Specifies the needed bond mode.

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.link-aggregation.options.primary`
    :   Specifies the preferred port of the bonding interface. The bond uses the primary device as the first device of the bonding interfaces. The bond does not abandon the primary device interface unless it fails. This setting is particularly useful when one NIC in the bonding interface is faster and, therefore, able to handle a bigger load. This setting is only valid when the bonding interface is in active-backup mode (mode 1).

    `hosts.networkconfig.interfaces.ipv4.address.ip`
    :   Specifies the static IP address for the bond interface. This is the node IP address.

    `hosts.networkconfig.routes.config.next-hop-interface`
    :   Specifies the value for the `routes.config.next-hop-interface` parameter. Sets `bond0` as the gateway for the default route.

    !!! warning

        After deploying the cluster, you cannot change the `networkConfig` configuration setting of the `install-config.yaml` file to make changes to the host network interface. Use the Kubernetes NMState Operator to make changes to the host network interface after deployment.

### Configuring multiple cluster nodes { #ipi-install-configure-multiple-cluster-nodes_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can simultaneously configure OpenShift Container Platform cluster nodes with identical settings. Configuring multiple cluster nodes avoids adding redundant information for each node to the `install-config.yaml` file. This file contains specific parameters to apply an identical configuration to multiple nodes in the cluster.

Compute nodes are configured separately from the controller node. However, configurations for both node types use the highlighted parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file to enable multi-node configuration. Set the `networkConfig` parameters to `BOND`, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
hosts:
- name: ostest-master-0
 [...]
 networkConfig: &BOND
   interfaces:
   - name: bond0
     type: bond
     state: up
     ipv4:
       dhcp: true
       enabled: true
     link-aggregation:
       mode: active-backup
       port:
       - enp2s0
       - enp3s0
- name: ostest-master-1
 [...]
 networkConfig: *BOND
- name: ostest-master-2
 [...]
 networkConfig: *BOND
```

!!! note

    Configuration of multiple cluster nodes is only available for initial deployments on installer-provisioned infrastructure.

### Configuring managed Secure Boot { #configuring-managed-secure-boot-in-the-install-config-file_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can enable managed Secure Boot when deploying an installer-provisioned cluster by using Redfish BMC addressing, such as `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia`.

**Procedure**

- Add the `bootMode` configuration setting for each node to enable managed Secure Boot.

    ```yaml title="Example"
    hosts:
      - name: openshift-master-0
        role: master
        bmc:
          address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip>
          username: <username>
          password: <password>
        bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
        rootDeviceHints:
         deviceName: "/dev/sda"
        bootMode: UEFISecureBoot
    ```

    - For `hosts.bmc.address`: Ensure the `bmc.address` setting uses `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol. See "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" or "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC" for additional details.

    - For `hosts.bbootMode`: The `bootMode` setting is `UEFI` by default. Change it to `UEFISecureBoot` to enable managed Secure Boot.

        !!! note

            See "Configuring nodes" in the "Prerequisites" to ensure the nodes can support managed Secure Boot. If the nodes do not support managed Secure Boot, see "Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually" in the "Configuring nodes" section. Configuring Secure Boot manually requires Redfish virtual media.

        !!! note

            Red Hat does not support Secure Boot with IPMI, because IPMI does not provide Secure Boot management facilities.

## Manifest configuration files { #ipi-install-manifest-configuration-files_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can customize your cluster installation by editing the manifest configuration files.

### Creating the OpenShift Container Platform manifests { #creating-the-openshift-manifests_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Create manifest files to begin customizing your cluster installation.

**Procedure**

- Create the OpenShift Container Platform manifests by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ ./openshift-baremetal-install --dir ~/clusterconfigs create manifests
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    INFO Consuming Install Config from target directory
    WARNING Making control-plane schedulable by setting MastersSchedulable to true for Scheduler cluster settings
    WARNING Discarding the OpenShift Manifest that was provided in the target directory because its dependencies are dirty and it needs to be regenerated
    ```

### Configuring NTP for disconnected clusters { #configuring-ntp-for-disconnected-clusters_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure NTP servers on control plane nodes and set compute nodes as NTP clients to ensure time synchronization in disconnected clusters that lack access to external NTP servers.

OpenShift Container Platform installs the `chrony` Network Time Protocol (NTP) service on the cluster nodes.

**Figure 5. Configuring NTP for disconnected clusters**

![Configuring NTP for disconnected clusters](../../../images/152_OpenShift_Config_NTP_0421.png)

OpenShift Container Platform nodes must agree on a date and time to run properly. When compute nodes retrieve the date and time from the NTP servers on the control plane nodes, it enables the installation and operation of clusters that are not connected to a routable network and thereby do not have access to a higher stratum NTP server.

**Procedure**

1. Install Butane on your installation host by using the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo dnf -y install butane
    ```

2. Create a Butane config, `99-master-chrony-conf-override.bu`, including the contents of the `chrony.conf` file for the control plane nodes.

    !!! note

        See "Creating machine configs with Butane" for information about Butane.

    ```yaml
    variant: openshift
    version: 4.22.0

              # Configure the control plane nodes to serve as local NTP servers
              # for all compute nodes, even if they are not in sync with an
              # upstream NTP server.

              # Allow NTP client access from the local network.
              allow all
              # Serve time even if not synchronized to a time source.
              local stratum 3 orphan
    ```

    where:

    `<cluster-name>`
    :   Specifies the name of the cluster.

    `<domain>`
    :   Specifies the fully qualified domain name.

3. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `99-master-chrony-conf-override.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the control plane nodes:

    ```terminal
    $ butane 99-master-chrony-conf-override.bu -o 99-master-chrony-conf-override.yaml
    ```

4. Create a Butane config, `99-worker-chrony-conf-override.bu`, including the contents of the `chrony.conf` file for the compute nodes that references the NTP servers on the control plane nodes.

    ```yaml
    variant: openshift
    version: 4.22.0
    metadata:
      name: 99-worker-chrony-conf-override
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
    storage:
      files:
        - path: /etc/chrony.conf
          mode: 0644
          overwrite: true
          contents:
            inline: |
              # The Machine Config Operator manages this file.
              server openshift-master-0.<cluster-name>.<domain> iburst
              server openshift-master-1.<cluster-name>.<domain> iburst
              server openshift-master-2.<cluster-name>.<domain> iburst

              stratumweight 0
              driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
              rtcsync
              makestep 10 3
              bindcmdaddress 127.0.0.1
              bindcmdaddress ::1
              keyfile /etc/chrony.keys
              commandkey 1
              generatecommandkey
              noclientlog
              logchange 0.5
              logdir /var/log/chrony
    ```

    where:

    `<cluster-name>`
    :   Specifies the name of the cluster.

    `<domain>`
    :   Specifies the fully qualified domain name.

5. Use Butane to generate a `MachineConfig` object file, `99-worker-chrony-conf-override.yaml`, containing the configuration to be delivered to the worker nodes:

    ```terminal
    $ butane 99-worker-chrony-conf-override.bu -o 99-worker-chrony-conf-override.yaml
    ```

### Configuring network components to run on the control plane { #configure-network-components-to-run-on-the-control-plane_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure networking components to run exclusively on the control plane nodes. By default, OpenShift Container Platform allows any node in the machine config pool to host the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address. However, some environments deploy compute nodes in separate subnets from the control plane nodes, which requires configuring the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address to run on the control plane nodes.

!!! warning

    When deploying remote nodes in separate subnets, you must place the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address exclusively with the control plane nodes.

![Installer-provisioned networking](../../../images/161_OpenShift_Baremetal_IPI_Deployment_updates_0521.png)

**Procedure**

1. Change to the directory storing the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```terminal
    $ cd ~/clusterconfigs
    ```

2. Switch to the `manifests` subdirectory:

    ```terminal
    $ cd manifests
    ```

3. Create a file named `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml`:

    ```terminal
    $ touch cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml
    ```

4. Open the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file in an editor and enter a custom resource (CR) that describes the Operator configuration:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      name: 50-worker-fix-ipi-rwn
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          files:
            - path: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/keepalived.yaml
              mode: 0644
              contents:
                source: data:,
    ```

    This manifest places the `ingressVIP` virtual IP address on the control plane nodes. Additionally, this manifest deploys the following processes on the control plane nodes only:

    - `openshift-ingress-operator`
    - `keepalived`

5. Save the `cluster-network-avoid-workers-99-config.yaml` file.

6. Create a `manifests/cluster-ingress-default-ingresscontroller.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: IngressController
    metadata:
      name: default
      namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
    spec:
      nodePlacement:
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/master: ""
    ```

7. Consider backing up the `manifests` directory. The installation program deletes the `manifests/` directory when creating the cluster.

8. Modify the `cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml` manifest to make the control plane nodes schedulable by setting the `mastersSchedulable` field to `true`. Control plane nodes are not schedulable by default. For example:

    ```
    $ sed -i "s;mastersSchedulable: false;mastersSchedulable: true;g" clusterconfigs/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml
    ```

    !!! note

        If control plane nodes are not schedulable after completing this procedure, deploying the cluster will fail.

### Deploying routers on compute nodes { #deploying-routers-on-worker-nodes_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

During installation, the installation program deploys router pods on compute nodes. By default, the installation program installs two router pods. If a deployed cluster requires additional routers to handle external traffic loads destined for services within the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you can create a `yaml` file to set an appropriate number of router replicas.

!!! warning

    Deploying a cluster with only one compute node is not supported. While modifying the router replicas will address issues with the `degraded` state when deploying with one compute node, the cluster loses high availability for the ingress API, which is not suitable for production environments.

!!! note

    By default, the installation program deploys two routers. If the cluster has no compute nodes, the installation program deploys the two routers on the control plane nodes by default.

**Procedure**

1. Create a `router-replicas.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
    kind: IngressController
    metadata:
      name: default
      namespace: openshift-ingress-operator
    spec:
      replicas: <num-of-router-pods>
      endpointPublishingStrategy:
        type: HostNetwork
      nodePlacement:
        nodeSelector:
          matchLabels:
            node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
    ```

    !!! note

        Replace `<num-of-router-pods>` with an appropriate value. If working with just one compute node, set `replicas:` to `1`. If working with more than 3 compute nodes, you can increase `replicas:` from the default value `2` as appropriate.

2. Save and copy the `router-replicas.yaml` file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory:

    ```terminal
    $ cp ~/router-replicas.yaml clusterconfigs/openshift/99_router-replicas.yaml
    ```

### Configuring the BIOS { #configuring-the-bios_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configures the BIOS during the installation process.

**Procedure**

1. Create the manifests.

2. Modify the `BareMetalHost` resource file corresponding to the node:

    ```terminal
    $ vim clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts-*.yaml
    ```

3. Add the BIOS configuration to the `spec` section of the `BareMetalHost` resource:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      firmware:
        simultaneousMultithreadingEnabled: true
        sriovEnabled: true
        virtualizationEnabled: true
    ```

    !!! note

        Red Hat supports three BIOS configurations. Only servers with BMC type `irmc` are supported. Other types of servers are currently not supported.

4. Create the cluster.

**Additional resources**

- [Configuration using the Bare Metal Operator](../bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration.md#bmo-config-using-bare-metal-operator_bare-metal-postinstallation-configuration)

### Configuring the RAID { #configuring-the-raid_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can configure a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) using baseboard management controllers (BMCs) during the installation process.

!!! note

    If you want to configure a hardware RAID for the node, verify that the node has a supported RAID controller. OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 does not support software RAID.

**Hardware RAID support by vendor**

| Vendor  | BMC and protocol   | Firmware version            | RAID levels        |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Fujitsu | iRMC               | N/A                         | 0, 1, 5, 6, and 10 |
| Dell    | iDRAC with Redfish | Version 6.10.30.20 or later | 0, 1, and 5        |

**Procedure**

1. Create the manifests.

2. Modify the `BareMetalHost` resource corresponding to the node:

    ```terminal
    $ vim clusterconfigs/openshift/99_openshift-cluster-api_hosts-*.yaml
    ```

    !!! note

        The following example uses a hardware RAID configuration because OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 does not support software RAID.

    1. If you added a specific RAID configuration to the `spec` section, this causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration in the `preparing` phase and perform a specified configuration on the RAID. For example:

        ```yaml
        spec:
          raid:
            hardwareRAIDVolumes:
            - level: "0"
              name: "sda"
              numberOfPhysicalDisks: 1
              rotational: true
              sizeGibibytes: 0
        ```

        The `level` parameter is a required field, and the others are optional fields.

    2. If you added an empty RAID configuration to the `spec` section, the empty configuration causes the node to delete the original RAID configuration during the `preparing` phase, but does not perform a new configuration. For example:

        ```yaml
        spec:
          raid:
            hardwareRAIDVolumes: []
        ```

    3. If you do not add a `raid` field in the `spec` section, the original RAID configuration is not deleted, and no new configuration will be performed.

3. Create the cluster.

### Configuring storage on nodes { #configuring-storage-on-nodes_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

You can make changes to operating systems on OpenShift Container Platform nodes by creating `MachineConfig` objects that are managed by the Machine Config Operator (MCO).

The `MachineConfig` specification includes an ignition config for configuring the machines at first boot. This config object can be used to modify files, systemd services, and other operating system features running on OpenShift Container Platform machines.

Use the ignition config to configure storage on nodes. The following `MachineSet` manifest example demonstrates about adding a partition to a device on a primary node. In this example, apply the manifest before installation to have a partition named `recovery` with a size of 16 GiB on the primary node.

**Procedure**

1. Create a `custom-partitions.yaml` file and include a `MachineConfig` object that contains your partition layout:

    ```terminal
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: MachineConfig
    metadata:
      labels:
        machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: primary
      name: 10_primary_storage_config
    spec:
      config:
        ignition:
          version: 3.2.0
        storage:
          disks:
            - device: </dev/xxyN>
              partitions:
                - label: recovery
                  startMiB: 32768
                  sizeMiB: 16384
          filesystems:
            - device: /dev/disk/by-partlabel/recovery
              label: recovery
              format: xfs
    ```

2. Save and copy the `custom-partitions.yaml` file to the `clusterconfigs/openshift` directory:

    ```terminal
    $ cp ~/<MachineConfig_manifest> ~/clusterconfigs/openshift
    ```

## Creating a disconnected registry { #ipi-install-creating-a-disconnected-registry_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

In some cases, you might want to install an OpenShift Container Platform cluster using a local copy of the installation registry. This could be for enhancing network efficiency because the cluster nodes are on a network that does not have access to the internet.

A local, or mirrored, copy of the registry requires the following:

- A certificate for the registry node. This can be a self-signed certificate.
- A web server that a container on a system will serve.
- An updated pull secret that contains the certificate and local repository information.

!!! note

    - Creating a disconnected registry on a registry node is optional. If you need to create a disconnected registry on a registry node, you must complete all of the following sub-sections.
    - If you have already prepared a mirror registry for a disconnected installation by mirroring images, you can skip directly to "Modify the install-config.yaml file to use the disconnected registry" section. For more information about preparing a mirror registry for a disconnected installation by mirroring images see, "Mirroring images for a disconnected installation".

**Additional resources**

- [Mirroring images for a disconnected installation](../../../disconnected/installing-mirroring-installation-images.md#prerequisites_installing-mirroring-installation-images)

### Preparing the registry node to host the mirrored registry { #ipi-install-preparing-a-disconnected-registry_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Prepare a registry node to host your local mirror registry for a OpenShift Container Platform installation.

Complete the following steps before hosting a mirrored registry on bare metal.

**Procedure**

1. Open the firewall port on the registry node:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5000/tcp --zone=libvirt  --permanent
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5000/tcp --zone=public   --permanent
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

2. Install the required packages for the registry node:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo yum -y install python3 podman httpd httpd-tools jq
    ```

3. Create the directory structure where the repository information will be held:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/registry/{auth,certs,data}
    ```

### Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository for a disconnected registry { #ipi-install-mirroring-for-disconnected-registry_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

Mirror the OpenShift Container Platform image repository to a local registry to provide your disconnected environment with the container images.

Complete the following steps to mirror the OpenShift Container Platform image repository for a disconnected registry.

!!! warning

    The `oc adm release mirror` command is deprecated as of OpenShift Container Platform 4.22 and will be removed in a future release.

    As an alternative, use the oc-mirror plugin v2.

**Prerequisites**

- Your mirror host has access to the internet.
- You configured a mirror registry to use in your restricted network and can access the certificate and credentials that you configured.
- You downloaded the [pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) and modified it to include authentication to your mirror repository.

**Procedure**

1. Review the [Download OpenShift Container Platform](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/) page to determine the version of OpenShift Container Platform that you want to install and determine the corresponding tag on the [Repository Tags](https://quay.io/repository/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release?tab=tags) page.

2. Set the required environment variables:

    1. Export the release version:

        ```terminal
        $ OCP_RELEASE=<release_version>
        ```

        For `<release_version>`, specify the tag that corresponds to the version of OpenShift Container Platform to install, such as `4.5.4`.

    2. Export the local registry name and host port:

        ```terminal
        $ LOCAL_REGISTRY='<local_registry_host_name>:<local_registry_host_port>'
        ```

        For `<local_registry_host_name>`, specify the registry domain name for your mirror repository, and for `<local_registry_host_port>`, specify the port that it serves content on.

    3. Export the local repository name:

        ```terminal
        $ LOCAL_REPOSITORY='<local_repository_name>'
        ```

        For `<local_repository_name>`, specify the name of the repository to create in your registry, such as `ocp4/openshift4`.

    4. Export the name of the repository to mirror:

        ```terminal
        $ PRODUCT_REPO='openshift-release-dev'
        ```

        For a production release, you must specify `openshift-release-dev`.

    5. Export the path to your registry pull secret:

        ```terminal
        $ LOCAL_SECRET_JSON='<path_to_pull_secret>'
        ```

        For `<path_to_pull_secret>`, specify the absolute path to and file name of the pull secret for your mirror registry that you created.

    6. Export the release mirror:

        ```terminal
        $ RELEASE_NAME="ocp-release"
        ```

        For a production release, you must specify `ocp-release`.

    7. Export the type of architecture for your cluster:

        ```terminal
        $ ARCHITECTURE=<cluster_architecture> (1)
        ```

        For `<cluster_architecture>`, specify the architecture of the cluster, such as `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `s390x`, or `ppc64le`.

    8. Export the path to the directory to host the mirrored images:

        ```terminal
        $ REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH=<path> (1)
        ```

        For `<path>`, specify the full path, including the initial forward slash (/) character.

3. Mirror the version images to the mirror registry:

    - If your mirror host does not have internet access, take the following actions:

        1. Connect the removable media to a system that is connected to the internet.

        2. Review the images and configuration manifests to mirror:

            ```terminal
            $ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
                 --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
                 --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
                 --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} --dry-run
            ```

        3. Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.

        4. Mirror the images to a directory on the removable media:

            ```terminal
            $ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --to-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
            ```

        5. Take the media to the restricted network environment and upload the images to the local container registry.

            ```terminal
            $ oc image mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --from-dir=${REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH}/mirror "file://openshift/release:${OCP_RELEASE}*" ${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} (1)
            ```

            For `REMOVABLE_MEDIA_PATH`, you must use the same path that you specified when you mirrored the images.

    - If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, take the following actions:

        1. Directly push the release images to the local registry by using following command:

            ```terminal
            $ oc adm release mirror -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON}  \
                 --from=quay.io/${PRODUCT_REPO}/${RELEASE_NAME}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE} \
                 --to=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY} \
                 --to-release-image=${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}
            ```

            This command pulls the release information as a digest, and its output includes the `imageContentSources` data that you require when you install your cluster.

        2. Record the entire `imageContentSources` section from the output of the previous command. The information about your mirrors is unique to your mirrored repository, and you must add the `imageContentSources` section to the `install-config.yaml` file during installation.

            !!! note

                The image name gets patched to Quay.io during the mirroring process, and the podman images will show Quay.io in the registry on the bootstrap virtual machine.

4. To create the installation program that is based on the content that you mirrored, extract it and pin it to the release:

    - If your mirror host does not have internet access, run the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-baremetal-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}"
        ```

    - If the local container registry is connected to the mirror host, run the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc adm release extract -a ${LOCAL_SECRET_JSON} --command=openshift-baremetal-install "${LOCAL_REGISTRY}/${LOCAL_REPOSITORY}:${OCP_RELEASE}-${ARCHITECTURE}"
        ```

        !!! warning

            To ensure that you use the correct images for the version of OpenShift Container Platform that you selected, you must extract the installation program from the mirrored content.

            You must perform this step on a machine with an active internet connection.

            If you are in a disconnected environment, use the `--image` flag as part of must-gather and point to the payload image.

5. For clusters using installer-provisioned infrastructure, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ openshift-baremetal-install
    ```

### Modify the install-config.yaml file to use the disconnected registry { #ipi-modify-install-config-for-a-disconnected-registry_ipi-install-installation-workflow }

On the provisioner node, the `install-config.yaml` file should use the newly created pull-secret from the `pull-secret-update.txt` file. The `install-config.yaml` file must also contain the disconnected registry node’s certificate and registry information.

**Procedure**

1. Add the disconnected registry node’s certificate to the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```terminal
    $ echo "additionalTrustBundle: |" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    The certificate should follow the `"additionalTrustBundle: |"` line and be properly indented, usually by two spaces.

    ```terminal
    $ sed -e 's/^/  /' /opt/registry/certs/domain.crt >> install-config.yaml
    ```

2. Add the mirror information for the registry to the `install-config.yaml` file:

    ```terminal
    $ echo "imageContentSources:" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ echo "- mirrors:" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ echo "  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4/openshift4" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    Replace `registry.example.com` with the registry’s fully qualified domain name.

    ```terminal
    $ echo "  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ echo "- mirrors:" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ echo "  - registry.example.com:5000/ocp4/openshift4" >> install-config.yaml
    ```

    Replace `registry.example.com` with the registry’s fully qualified domain name.

    ```terminal
    $ echo "  source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev" >> install-config.yaml
    ```
