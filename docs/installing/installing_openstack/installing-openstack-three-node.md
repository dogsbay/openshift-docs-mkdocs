# Installing a three-node cluster on OpenStack { #installing-openstack-three-node }

In OpenShift Container Platform version 4.22, you can install a three-node cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). A three-node cluster consists of three control plane machines, which also act as compute machines. 

This type of cluster provides a smaller, more resource efficient cluster, for cluster administrators and developers to use for testing, development, and production.

You can install a three-node cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure only. After you install a three-node cluster on RHOSP, you can apply customizations to the cluster. For more information, see "Installing a cluster on RHOSP with customizations".

## Configuring a three-node cluster { #installation-three-node-cluster_installing-openstack-three-node }

To configure a three-node cluster, set the number of worker nodes to `0` in the `install-config.yaml` file before you deploy the cluster.

Setting the number of worker nodes to `0` ensures that the control plane machines are schedulable. This allows application workloads to be scheduled to run from the control plane nodes.

!!! note

    Because application workloads run from control plane nodes, additional subscriptions are required, as the control plane nodes are considered to be compute nodes.

**Prerequisites**

- You have an existing `install-config.yaml` file.

**Procedure**

- Set the number of compute replicas to `0` in your `install-config.yaml` file, as shown in the following `compute` stanza:

.Example `install-config.yaml` file for a three-node cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
- name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 0
# ...
```
