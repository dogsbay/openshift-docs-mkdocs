# About remote health monitoring { #about-remote-health-monitoring }

OpenShift Container Platform collects telemetry and configuration data about your cluster and reports it to Red Hat by using the Telemeter Client and the Insights Operator. The data that is provided to Red Hat enables the benefits outlined in this document.

A cluster that reports data to Red Hat through Telemetry and the Insights Operator is considered a *connected cluster*.

Telemetry is the term that Red Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red Hat by the OpenShift Container Platform Telemeter Client. Lightweight attributes are sent from connected clusters to Red Hat to enable subscription management automation, monitor the health of clusters, assist with support, and improve customer experience.

The Insights Operator gathers OpenShift Container Platform configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is used to produce insights about potential issues that a cluster might be exposed to. These insights are communicated to cluster administrators on [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift).

More information is provided in this document about these two processes.

## Telemetry and Insights Operator benefits { #telemetry-insights-operator-benefits_about-remote-health-monitoring }

Telemetry and the Insights Operator enable certain benefits to end users such as accelerated issue resolution, streamlined customer support, optimized software releases, and prioritized new features.

These benefits are listed as follows:

- **Enhanced identification and resolution of issues**. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red Hat from a broader perspective across a fleet of clusters. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a Jira issue.
- **Advanced release management**. OpenShift Container Platform offers the `candidate`, `fast`, and `stable` release channels, which enable you to choose an update strategy. The graduation of a release from `fast` to `stable` is dependent on the success rate of updates and on the events seen during upgrades. With the information provided by connected clusters, Red Hat can improve the quality of releases to `stable` channels and react more rapidly to issues found in the `fast` channels.
- **Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality**. The data collected provides insights about which areas of OpenShift Container Platform are used most. With this information, Red Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.
- **A streamlined support experience**. You can provide a cluster ID for a connected cluster when creating a support ticket on the Red Hat Customer Portal. This enables Red Hat to deliver a streamlined support experience that is specific to your cluster, by using the connected information. This document provides more information about that enhanced support experience.
- **Predictive analytics**. The insights displayed for your cluster on [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) are enabled by the information collected from connected clusters. Red Hat is investing in applying deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence automation to help identify issues that OpenShift Container Platform clusters are exposed to.

## About Telemetry { #telemetry-about-telemetry_about-remote-health-monitoring }

Telemetry sends a carefully chosen subset of the cluster monitoring metrics to Red Hat. The Telemeter Client fetches the metrics values every four minutes and thirty seconds and uploads the data to Red Hat. These metrics are described in this document.

This stream of data is used by Red Hat to monitor the clusters in real-time and to react as necessary to problems that impact our customers. Red Hat can use the streamed data to roll out OpenShift Container Platform upgrades to customers to minimize service impact and continuously improve the upgrade experience.

This debugging information is available to Red Hat Support and Engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported through support cases. All connected cluster information is used by Red Hat to help make OpenShift Container Platform better and more intuitive to use.

## About the Insights Operator { #insights-operator-about_about-remote-health-monitoring }

The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry.

Users of OpenShift Container Platform can display the report of each cluster in the [Advisor](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/) service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. If any issues have been identified, Red Hat Lightspeed provides further details and, if available, steps on how to solve a problem.

The Insights Operator does not collect identifying information, such as user names, passwords, or certificates. For information about Red Hat Lightspeed data collection and controls, see Red Hat Lightspeed Data &amp; Application Security.

Red Hat uses all connected cluster information to:

- Identify potential cluster issues and provide a solution and preventive actions in the [Advisor](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/) service on Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console
- Improve OpenShift Container Platform by providing aggregated and critical information to product and support teams
- Make OpenShift Container Platform more intuitive

## Understanding Telemetry and Insights Operator data flow { #understanding-telemetry-and-insights-operator-data-flow_about-remote-health-monitoring }

The Telemeter Client collects selected time series data from the Prometheus API. The time series data is uploaded to api.openshift.com every four minutes and thirty seconds for processing.

The Insights Operator gathers selected data from the Kubernetes API and the Prometheus API into an archive. The archive is uploaded to [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift) every two hours for processing. The Insights Operator also downloads the latest Red Hat Lightspeed analysis from [OpenShift Cluster Manager](https://console.redhat.com/openshift). This is used to populate the **Red Hat Lightspeed status** pop-up that is included in the **Overview** page in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

All of the communication with Red Hat occurs over encrypted channels by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and mutual certificate authentication. All of the data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Access to the systems that handle customer data is controlled through multi-factor authentication and strict authorization controls. Access is granted on a need-to-know basis and is limited to required operations.
