# Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal { #hcp-destroy-bm }

You might want to remove a hosted cluster if you are no longer using it, you are trying to reduce resources, or the hosted cluster is experiencing issues that are difficult to resolve.

## Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the CLI { #destroy-hc-bm-cli_hcp-destroy-bm }

If you created a hosted cluster by using the command-line interface (CLI), you can destroy that hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running a command.

**Procedure**

- Delete the hosted cluster and its back-end resources by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete -f <hosted_cluster_config>.yaml
    ```

    Specify the name of the configuration YAML file that was rendered when you created the hosted cluster.

    !!! note

        If you created the hosted cluster without specifying the `--render` and `--render-sensitive` flags in its configuration file, you must remove its back-end resources manually.

## Destroying a hosted cluster on bare metal by using the web console { #destroy-hc-bm-console_hcp-destroy-bm }

**Procedure**

1. In the console, click **Infrastructure** → **Clusters**.
2. On the **Clusters** page, select the cluster that you want to destroy.
3. In the **Actions** menu, select **Destroy clusters** to remove the cluster.
