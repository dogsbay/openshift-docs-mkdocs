You might want to remove a hosted cluster if you are no longer using it, you are trying to reduce resources, or the hosted cluster is experiencing issues that are difficult to resolve.

## Destroying a hosted cluster on IBM Power by using the CLI { #destroy-hc-ibm-power-cli_hcp-destroy-ibm-power }

To destroy a hosted cluster on IBM Power, you can use the hcp command-line interface (CLI).

    $ hcp destroy cluster agent
     --name=<hosted_cluster_name> \
     --namespace=<hosted_cluster_namespace> \

    ```

    - `<hosted_cluster_name>` specifies the name of your hosted cluster.
