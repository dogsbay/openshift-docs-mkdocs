# Tailoring the Compliance Operator { #compliance-operator-tailor }

Although the Compliance Operator includes ready-to-use profiles, you must modify the profiles to fit your organization’s requirements. The process of modifying a profile is called *tailoring*.

The Compliance Operator provides the `TailoredProfile` object to help tailor profiles.

## Creating a new tailored profile { #compliance-new-tailored-profiles_compliance-tailor }

You can write a tailored profile from scratch by using the `TailoredProfile` object. Set an appropriate `title` and `description` and leave the `extends` field empty. 

Indicate to the Compliance Operator what type of scan this custom profile will generate:

- Node scan: Scans the operating system.
- Platform scan: Scans the OpenShift Container Platform configuration.

**Procedure**

- Set the following annotation on the `TailoredProfile` object:

    ```yaml title="Example new-profile.yaml"
    apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: TailoredProfile
    metadata:
      name: new-profile
      annotations:
        compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Node
    spec:
      extends: ocp4-cis-node
      description: My custom profile
      title: Custom profile
      enableRules:
        - name: ocp4-etcd-unique-ca
          rationale: We really need to enable this
      disableRules:
        - name: ocp4-file-groupowner-cni-conf
          rationale: This does not apply to the cluster
    ```

    where:

    `metadata.annotations.compliance.openshift.io/product-type`
    :   Sets `Node` or `Platform` accordingly.

    `spec.extends`
    :   Optional field to specify the base profile.

    `spec.description`
    :   Specifies the function of the new `TailoredProfile` object.

    `spec.title`
    :   Specifies a title for the `TailoredProfile` object.

!!! note

    Adding the `-node` suffix to the `name` field of the `TailoredProfile` object is similar to adding the `Node` product type annotation and generates an operating system scan.

## Using tailored profiles to extend existing ProfileBundles { #compliance-tailored-profiles_compliance-tailor }

Although the `TailoredProfile` CR enables the most common tailoring operations, you can use the XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) standard for even more flexibility in tailoring OpenSCAP profiles.

In addition, if your organization has been using OpenScap previously, you might have an existing XCCDF tailoring file and can reuse it.

The `ComplianceSuite` object has an optional `TailoringConfigMap` attribute that you can point to a custom tailoring file. The value of the `TailoringConfigMap` attribute is a name of a config map, which must contain a key called `tailoring.xml` and the value of this key is the tailoring contents.

**Procedure**

1. Browse the available rules for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) `ProfileBundle`:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get rules.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
    ```

2. Browse the available variables in the same `ProfileBundle`:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get variables.compliance -n openshift-compliance -l compliance.openshift.io/profile-bundle=rhcos4
    ```

3. Create a tailored profile named `nist-moderate-modified`:

    1. Choose which rules you want to add to the `nist-moderate-modified` tailored profile. This example extends the `rhcos4-moderate` profile by disabling two rules and changing one value. Use the `rationale` value to describe why these changes were made:

        ```yaml title="Example new-profile-node.yaml"
        apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: TailoredProfile
        metadata:
          name: nist-moderate-modified
        spec:
          extends: rhcos4-moderate
          description: NIST moderate profile
          title: My modified NIST moderate profile
          disableRules:
          - name: rhcos4-file-permissions-var-log-messages
            rationale: The file contains logs of error messages in the system
          - name: rhcos4-account-disable-post-pw-expiration
            rationale: No need to check this as it comes from the IdP
          setValues:
          - name: rhcos4-var-selinux-state
            rationale: Organizational requirements
            value: permissive
        ```

1.  Add the `tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules` attribute:
    ```yaml title="Example tailoredProfile.spec.manualRules.yaml"
    apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: TailoredProfile
    metadata:
      name: ocp4-manual-scc-check
    spec:
      extends: ocp4-cis
      description: This profile extends ocp4-cis by forcing the SCC check to always return MANUAL
      title: OCP4 CIS profile with manual SCC check
      manualRules:
        - name: ocp4-scc-limit-container-allowed-capabilities
          rationale: We use third party software that installs its own SCC with extra privileges
    ```
1.  Create the `TailoredProfile` object:
    ```terminal
    $ oc create -n openshift-compliance -f new-profile-node.yaml
    ```
    *   The `TailoredProfile` object is created in the default `openshift-compliance` namespace.
        ```terminal title="Example output"
        tailoredprofile.compliance.openshift.io/nist-moderate-modified created
        ```
````

1. Define the `ScanSettingBinding` object to bind the new `nist-moderate-modified` tailored profile to the default `ScanSetting` object.

    ```yaml title="Example new-scansettingbinding.yaml"
    apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ScanSettingBinding
    metadata:
      name: nist-moderate-modified
    profiles:
      - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Profile
        name: ocp4-moderate
      - apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
        kind: TailoredProfile
        name: nist-moderate-modified
    settingsRef:
      apiGroup: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
      kind: ScanSetting
      name: default
    ```

2. Create the `ScanSettingBinding` object:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -n openshift-compliance -f new-scansettingbinding.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    scansettingbinding.compliance.openshift.io/nist-moderate-modified created
    ```
