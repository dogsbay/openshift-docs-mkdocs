# Control plane certificates { #cert-types-control-plane-certificates }

Review control plane certificate namespaces and automatic rotation in OpenShift Container Platform to plan maintenance and recover from expiration.

## Location { #control-plane-certs-location_cert-types-control-plane-certificates }

Control plane certificates are included in these namespaces:

- `openshift-config-managed`
- `openshift-kube-apiserver`
- `openshift-kube-apiserver-operator`
- `openshift-kube-controller-manager`
- `openshift-kube-controller-manager-operator`
- `openshift-kube-scheduler`

## Management { #control-plane-certs-management_cert-types-control-plane-certificates }

Control plane certificates are managed by the system and rotated automatically.

If control plane certificates expire, see "Recovering from expired control plane certificates".
