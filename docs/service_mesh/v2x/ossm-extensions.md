# Extensions { #ossm-extensions }

You can use WebAssembly extensions to add new features directly into the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh proxies. This lets you move even more common functionality out of your applications, and implement them in a single language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode.

!!! note

    WebAssembly extensions are not supported on IBM Z(R) and IBM Power(R).

## WebAssembly modules overview { #ossm-extensions-overview_ossm-extensions }

WebAssembly modules can be run on many platforms, including proxies, and have broad language support, fast execution, and a sandboxed-by-default security model.

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions are [Envoy HTTP Filters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.20.0/intro/arch_overview/http/http_filters#arch-overview-http-filters), giving them a wide range of capabilities:

- Manipulating the body and headers of requests and responses.
- Out-of-band HTTP requests to services not in the request path, such as authentication or policy checking.
- Side-channel data storage and queues for filters to communicate with each other.

!!! note

    When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the `WasmPlugin` API. The `ServiceMeshExtension` API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.

There are two parts to writing a Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extension:

1. You must write your extension using an SDK that exposes the [proxy-wasm API](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) and compile it to a WebAssembly module.
2. You must then package the module into a container.

**Supported languages**

You can use any language that compiles to WebAssembly bytecode to write a Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extension, but the following languages have existing SDKs that expose the proxy-wasm API so that it can be consumed directly.

## `WasmPlugin` container format { #ossm-extensions-wasmplugin-format_ossm-extensions }

Istio supports Open Container Initiative (OCI) images in its Wasm Plugin mechanism. You can distribute your Wasm Plugins as a container image, and you can use the `spec.url` field to refer to a container registry location.  For example, `quay.io/my-username/my-plugin:latest`.

Because each execution environment (runtime) for a WASM module can have runtime-specific configuration parameters, a WASM image can be composed of two layers:

- **plugin.wasm** (Required) - Content layer. This layer consists of a `.wasm` binary containing the bytecode of your WebAssembly module, to be loaded by the runtime.  You must name this file `plugin.wasm`.
- **runtime-config.json** (Optional) - Configuration layer. This layer consists of a JSON-formatted string that describes metadata about the module for the target runtime. The config layer might also contain additional data, depending on the target runtime. For example, the config for a WASM Envoy Filter contains root_ids available on the filter.

## WasmPlugin API reference { #ossm-wasm-ref-wasmplugin_ossm-extensions }

The WasmPlugins API provides a mechanism to extend the functionality provided by the Istio proxy through WebAssembly filters.

You can deploy multiple WasmPlugins. The `phase` and `priority` settings determine the order of execution (as part of Envoy’s filter chain), allowing the configuration of complex interactions between user-supplied WasmPlugins and Istio’s internal filters.

In the following example, an authentication filter implements an OpenID flow and populates the Authorization header with a JSON Web Token (JWT). Istio authentication consumes this token and deploys it to the ingress gateway. The WasmPlugin file lives in the proxy sidecar filesystem. Note the field `url`.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: openid-connect
  namespace: istio-ingress
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  url: file:///opt/filters/openid.wasm
  sha256: 1ef0c9a92b0420cf25f7fe5d481b231464bc88f486ca3b9c83ed5cc21d2f6210
  phase: AUTHN
  pluginConfig:
    openid_server: authn
    openid_realm: ingress
```

Below is the same example, but this time an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image is used instead of a file in the filesystem. Note the fields `url`, `imagePullPolicy`, and `imagePullSecret`.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: openid-connect
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      istio: ingressgateway
  url: oci://private-registry:5000/openid-connect/openid:latest
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  imagePullSecret: private-registry-pull-secret
  phase: AUTHN
  pluginConfig:
    openid_server: authn
    openid_realm: ingress
```

The `WorkloadSelector` object specifies the criteria used to determine if a filter can be applied to a proxy. The matching criteria includes the metadata associated with a proxy, workload instance information such as labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other information that the proxy provides to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload instance to be selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.

### Deploying `WasmPlugin` resources { #ossm-wasmplugin-deploy_ossm-extensions }

You can enable Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions using the `WasmPlugin` resource. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project. The following example creates an `openid-connect` filter that performs an OpenID Connect flow to authenticate the user.

**Procedure**

1. Create the following example resource:

    ```yaml title="Example plugin.yaml"
    apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
    kind: WasmPlugin
    metadata:
      name: openid-connect
      namespace: istio-system
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          istio: ingressgateway
      url: oci://private-registry:5000/openid-connect/openid:latest
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      imagePullSecret: private-registry-pull-secret
      phase: AUTHN
      pluginConfig:
        openid_server: authn
        openid_realm: ingress
    ```

2. Apply your `plugin.yaml` file with the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f plugin.yaml
    ```

## `ServiceMeshExtension` container format { #ossm-extensions-smextension-format_ossm-extensions }

You must have a `.wasm` file containing the bytecode of your WebAssembly module, and a `manifest.yaml` file in the root of the container filesystem to make your container image a valid extension image.

!!! note

    When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the `WasmPlugin` API. The `ServiceMeshExtension` API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.

```yaml title="manifest.yaml"
schemaVersion: 1

name: <your-extension>
description: <description>
version: 1.0.0
phase: PreAuthZ
priority: 100

## ServiceMeshExtension reference { #ossm-wasm-ref-smextension_ossm-extensions }

The ServiceMeshExtension API provides a mechanism to extend the functionality provided by the Istio proxy through WebAssembly filters. There are two parts to writing a WebAssembly extension:

1. Write your extension using an SDK that exposes the proxy-wasm API and compile it to a WebAssembly module.
2. Package it into a container.

### Deploying `ServiceMeshExtension` resources { #ossm-smextensions-deploy_ossm-extensions }

You can enable Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh extensions using the `ServiceMeshExtension` resource. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the Service Mesh control plane project.

!!! note

    When creating new WebAssembly extensions, use the `WasmPlugin` API. The `ServiceMeshExtension` API was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2 and removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3.

For a complete example that was built using the Rust SDK, take a look at the [header-append-filter](https://github.com/maistra/header-append-filter). It is a simple filter that appends one or more headers to the HTTP responses, with their names and values taken out from the `config` field of the extension. See a sample configuration in the snippet below.

**Procedure**

1. Create the following example resource:

    ```yaml title="Example ServiceMeshExtension resource extension.yaml"
    apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
    kind: ServiceMeshExtension
    metadata:
      name: header-append
      namespace: istio-system
    spec:
      workloadSelector:
        labels:
          app: httpbin
      config:
        first-header: some-value
        another-header: another-value
      image: quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.1
      phase: PostAuthZ
      priority: 100
    ```

2. Apply your `extension.yaml` file with the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc apply -f <extension>.yaml
    ```

## Migrating from `ServiceMeshExtension` to `WasmPlugin` resources { #ossm-extensions-migration-overview_ossm-extensions }

The `ServiceMeshExtension` API, which was deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.2, was removed in Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh version 2.3. If you are using the `ServiceMeshExtension` API, you must migrate to the `WasmPlugin` API to continue using your WebAssembly extensions.

The APIs are very similar. The migration consists of two steps:

1. Renaming your plugin file and updating the module packaging.
2. Creating a `WasmPlugin` resource that references the updated container image.

### API changes { #ossm-extensions-migration-api-changes_ossm-extensions }

The new `WasmPlugin` API is similar to the `ServiceMeshExtension`, but with a few differences, especially in the field names:

**Field changes between `ServiceMeshExtensions` and `WasmPlugin`**

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>ServiceMeshExtension</td>
  <td>WasmPlugin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spec.config</code></td>
  <td><code>spec.pluginConfig</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spec.workloadSelector</code></td>
  <td><code>spec.selector</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spec.image</code></td>
  <td><code>spec.url</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>spec.phase</code> valid values: PreAuthN, PostAuthN, PreAuthZ, PostAuthZ, PreStats, PostStats</td>
  <td><code>spec.phase</code> valid values: <empty>, AUTHN, AUTHZ, STATS</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The following is an example of how a `ServiceMeshExtension` resource could be converted into a `WasmPlugin` resource.

```yaml title="ServiceMeshExtension resource"
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshExtension
metadata:
  name: header-append
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  workloadSelector:
    labels:
      app: httpbin
  config:
    first-header: some-value
    another-header: another-value
  image: quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.2
  phase: PostAuthZ
  priority: 100
```

```yaml title="New WasmPlugin resource equivalent to the ServiceMeshExtension above"
apiVersion: extensions.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: WasmPlugin
metadata:
  name: header-append
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpbin
  url: oci://quay.io/maistra-dev/header-append-filter:2.2
  phase: STATS
  pluginConfig:
    first-header: some-value
    another-header: another-value
```

### Container image format changes { #ossm-extensions-migration-format-changes_ossm-extensions }

The new `WasmPlugin` container image format is similar to the `ServiceMeshExtensions`, with the following differences:

- The `ServiceMeshExtension` container format required a metadata file named `manifest.yaml` in the root directory of the container filesystem. The `WasmPlugin` container format does not require a `manifest.yaml` file.
- The `.wasm` file (the actual plugin) that previously could have any filename now must be named `plugin.wasm` and must be located in the root directory of the container filesystem.

### Migrating to `WasmPlugin` resources { #ossm-extensions-migrating-to-wasmplugin_ossm-extensions }

To upgrade your WebAssembly extensions from the `ServiceMeshExtension` API to the `WasmPlugin` API, you rename your plugin file.

**Prerequisites**

- `ServiceMeshControlPlane` is upgraded to version 2.2 or later.

**Procedure**

1. Update your container image. If the plugin is already in `/plugin.wasm` inside the container, skip to the next step.  If not:

    1. Ensure the plugin file is named `plugin.wasm`. You must name the extension file `plugin.wasm`.
    2. Ensure the plugin file is located in the root (/) directory. You must store extension files in the root of the container filesystem..
    3. Rebuild your container image and push it to a container registry.

2. Remove the `ServiceMeshExtension` resource and create a `WasmPlugin` resource that refers to the new container image you built.
