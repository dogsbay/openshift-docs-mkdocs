title: Using quotas and limit ranges
---

# Using quotas and limit ranges { #compute-resource-quotas }

As a cluster administrator, you can use quotas and limit ranges to set constraints. These constraints limit the number of objects or the amount of compute resources that are used in your project.

By using quotes and limits, you can better manage and allocate resources across all projects. You can also ensure that no projects use more resources than is appropriate for the cluster size.

A resource quota, defined by a `ResourceQuota` object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. The quota can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type. Additinally, the quota can limit the total amount of compute resources and storage that might be consumed by resources in that project.

!!! warning

    Quotas are set by cluster administrators and are scoped to a given project. OpenShift Container Platform project owners can change quotas for their project, but not limit ranges. OpenShift Container Platform users cannot modify quotas or limit ranges.

## Resources managed by quota { #admin-quota-overview_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To limit aggregate resource consumption per project, define a `ResourceQuota` object. By using this object, you can restrict the number of created objects by type. You can also restrict the total amount of compute resources and storage consumed within the project.

The following tables describe the set of compute resources and object types that a quota might manage.

!!! note

    A pod is in a terminal state if `status.phase` is `Failed` or `Succeeded`.

You can configure an object count quota for these standard namespaced resource types using the `count/<resource>.<group>` syntax.

```terminal
$ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
```

where:

`<resource>`
:   Specifies the name of the resource.

`<group>`
:   Specifies the API group, if applicable. You can use the `kubectl api-resources` command for a list of resources and their associated API groups.

## Setting resource quota for extended resources { #setting-resource-quota-extended-resources_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To manage the consumption of extended resources, such as `nvidia.com/gpu`, define a resource quota by using the `requests` prefix. Since overcommitment is prohibited for these resources, you must explicitly specify both requests and limits to ensure valid configuration.

**Procedure**

1. To determine how many GPUs are available on a node in your cluster, use the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe node ip-172-31-27-209.us-west-2.compute.internal | egrep 'Capacity|Allocatable|gpu'
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    openshift.com/gpu-accelerator=true
    Capacity:
     nvidia.com/gpu:  2
    Allocatable:
     nvidia.com/gpu:  2
     nvidia.com/gpu:  0           0
    ```

    In this example, 2 GPUs are available.

2. Use this command to set a quota in the namespace `nvidia`. In this example, the quota is `1`:

    ```terminal
    $ cat gpu-quota.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ResourceQuota
    metadata:
      name: gpu-quota
      namespace: nvidia
    spec:
      hard:
        requests.nvidia.com/gpu: 1
    ```

3. Create the quota with the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f gpu-quota.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    resourcequota/gpu-quota created
    ```

4. Verify that the namespace has the correct quota set using the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe quota gpu-quota -n nvidia
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Name:                    gpu-quota
    Namespace:               nvidia
    Resource                 Used  Hard
    --------                 ----  ----
    requests.nvidia.com/gpu  0     1
    ```

5. Run a pod that asks for a single GPU with the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create pod gpu-pod.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      generateName: gpu-pod-s46h7
      namespace: nvidia
    spec:
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
      containers:
      - name: rhel7-gpu-pod
        image: rhel7
        env:
          - name: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
            value: all
          - name: NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
            value: "compute,utility"
          - name: NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA
            value: "cuda>=5.0"

        command: ["sleep"]
        args: ["infinity"]

        resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: 1
    ```

6. Verify that the pod is running with the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pods
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME              READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    gpu-pod-s46h7     1/1       Running     0          1m
    ```

7. Verify that the quota `Used` counter is correct by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe quota gpu-quota -n nvidia
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Name:                    gpu-quota
    Namespace:               nvidia
    Resource                 Used  Hard
    --------                 ----  ----
    requests.nvidia.com/gpu  1     1
    ```

8. Using the following command, attempt to create a second GPU pod in the `nvidia` namespace. This is technically available on the node because it has 2 GPUs:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f gpu-pod.yaml
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "gpu-pod.yaml": pods "gpu-pod-f7z2w" is forbidden: exceeded quota: gpu-quota, requested: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1, used: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1, limited: requests.nvidia.com/gpu=1
    ```

    You receive this `Forbidden` error message because you have a quota of 1 GPU and the pod tried to allocate a second GPU, which exceeds the allowed quota.

## Quota scopes { #quota-scopes_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To restrict the set of resources that a quota applies to, add associated scopes. This configuration limits usage measurement to the intersection of the enumerated scopes, ensuring that specifying a resource outside the allowed set results in a validation error.

A `BestEffort` scope restricts a quota to limiting the following resources:

- pods

A `Terminating`, `NotTerminating`, and `NotBestEffort` scope restricts a quota to tracking the following resources:

- `pods`
- `memory`
- `requests.memory`
- `limits.memory`
- `cpu`
- `requests.cpu`
- `limits.cpu`
- `ephemeral-storage`
- `requests.ephemeral-storage`
- `limits.ephemeral-storage`

!!! note

    Ephemeral storage requests and limits apply only if you enabled the ephemeral storage technology preview. This feature is disabled by default.

You can also limit a quota with the optional `scopeSelector` field. In `scopeSelector.matchExpressions`, set a `scopeName`, an `operator`, and, when required, a `values` array. Scopes such as `PriorityClass` and `VolumeAttributesClass` match resources when the selector selects them.

The `operator` field supports the following values:

- `In`
- `NotIn`
- `Exists`
- `DoesNotExist`

If the `operator` is `In` or `NotIn`, the `values` field must include at least one value. If the `operator` is `Exists` or `DoesNotExist`, do not set `values`.

## Admin quota usage { #admin-quota-usage_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To ensure projects remain within defined constraints, monitor admin quota usage. After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the ability to create any new resources that can violate a quota constraint until it has calculated updated usage statistics.

Quota enforcement
:   After a resource quota for a project is first created, the project restricts the ability to create any new resources that can violate a quota constraint until the quota has calculated updated usage statistics.

    After a quota is created and usage statistics are updated, the project accepts the creation of new content. When you create or modify resources, your quota usage is incremented immediately upon the request to create or modify the resource.

    When you delete a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full recalculation of quota statistics for the project.

    A configurable amount of time determines how long the quota takes to reduce quota usage statistics to their current observed system value.

    If project modifications exceed a quota usage limit, the server denies the action and returns an appropriate error message to the user. The error message explains the quota constraint violated and what their currently observed usage statistics are in the system.

Requests compared to limits
:   When allocating compute resources by quota, each container can specify a request and a limit value each for CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage. Quotas can restrict any of these values.

    If the quota has a value specified for `requests.cpu` or `requests.memory`, then the quota requires that every incoming container makes an explicit request for those resources. If the quota has a value specified for `limits.cpu` or `limits.memory`, the quota requires that every incoming container specify an explicit limit for those resources.

### Creating a quota { #creating-a-quota_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To create a quota, define a `ResourceQuota` object in a file and apply the file to a project. By doing this task, you can restrict aggregate resource consumption and object counts within the project to ensure the project complies with cluster policies.

**Procedure**

- To apply resource constraints to a specific project, create a `ResourceQuota` object by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). Run the following `oc create` command with your definition file to enforce the limits on aggregate resource consumption and object counts specified for that namespace:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <resource_quota_definition> [-n <project_name>]
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example command to create a ResourceQuota object"
    $ oc create -f core-object-counts.yaml -n demoproject
    ```

### Creating object count quotas { #creating-object-count-quotas_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To manage the consumption of standard namespaced resource types, create an object count quota. By creating an object count quota within a OpenShift Container Platform project, you can set defined limits on the number of objects, such as `BuildConfig` and `DeploymentConfig` objects.

When you use a resource quota, OpenShift Container Platform charges an object against the quota if the object exists in server storage. These quotas protect against exhaustion of storage resources.

**Procedure**

1. To configure an object count quota for a resource, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create quota <name> --hard=count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>,count/<resource>.<group>=<quota>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example showing object count quota"
    $ oc create quota test --hard=count/deployments.extensions=2,count/replicasets.extensions=4,count/pods=3,count/secrets=4
    resourcequota "test" created
    ```

2. To inspect the detailed status of the object count quota, use the following `oc describe` command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe quota test
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Name:                         test
    Namespace:                    quota
    Resource                      Used  Hard
    --------                      ----  ----
    count/deployments.extensions  0     2
    count/pods                    0     3
    count/replicasets.extensions  0     4
    count/secrets                 0     4
    ```

    This example limits the listed resources to the hard limit in each project in the cluster.

### Viewing a quota { #viewing-a-quota_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To monitor usage statistics against defined hard limits, navigate to the **Quota** page in the web console. Alternatively, you can use the CLI to view detailed quota information for the project.

**Procedure**

1. Get the list of quotas defined in the project by entering the following command:

    ```terminal title="Example command with a project called demoproject"
    $ oc get quota -n demoproject
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                AGE
    besteffort          11m
    compute-resources   2m
    core-object-counts  29m
    ```

2. Describe the target quota by entering the following command:

    ```terminal title="Example command for the core-object-counts quota"
    $ oc describe quota core-object-counts -n demoproject
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Name:			core-object-counts
    Namespace:		demoproject
    Resource		Used	Hard
    --------		----	----
    configmaps		3	10
    persistentvolumeclaims	0	4
    replicationcontrollers	3	20
    secrets			9	10
    services		2	10
    ```

### Configuring quota synchronization period { #configuring-quota-synchronization-period_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

When a set of resources are deleted, the synchronization time frame of resources is determined by the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting in the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file. You can change the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting to have the set of resources regenerate in the needed amount of time (in seconds) for the resources to be once again available.

!!! note

    Before quota usage is restored, you might encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources.

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and determining resource usage when automation is used.

!!! note

    The `resource-quota-sync-period` setting balances system performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the controller.

**Procedure**

1. To specify the time required for resources to regenerate and become available again, edit the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting. With this configuration, you can set the synchronization interval in seconds.

    ```yaml title="Example of the resource-quota-sync-period setting"
    kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiLevels:
      - v1beta3
      - v1
      apiServerArguments: null
      controllerArguments:
        resource-quota-sync-period:
          - "10s"
    # ...
    ```

2. Restart the controller services to apply them to your cluster by entering the following commands:

    ```terminal
    $ master-restart api
    ```

    ```terminal
    $ master-restart controllers
    ```

### Setting a quota to consume a resource { #setting-quota-to-consume-resource_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To restrict the amount of a resource that a user can consume, set a quota. By doing this task, you can prevent unbounded usage of resources, such as storage classes, ensuring that project consumption remains within defined limits.

If a quota does not manage a resource, a user has no restriction on the amount of that resource that can be consumed. For example, if there is no quota on storage related to the gold storage class, the amount of gold storage a project can create is unbounded.

For high-cost compute or storage resources, administrators can require an explicit quota be granted to consume a resource. For example, if a project was not explicitly given quota for storage related to the gold storage class, users of that project would not be able to create any storage of that type.

The example in the procedure shows how the quota system intercepts every operation that creates or updates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource. The quota system checks what resources controlled by quota would be consumed. If there is no covering quota for those resources in the project, the request is denied. In this example, if a user creates a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource that uses storage associated with the gold storage class and there is no matching quota in the project, the request is denied.

**Procedure**

- Add the following stanza to the `master-config.yaml` file. This stanza requires explicit quota to consume a particular resource.

    ```yaml
    admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        ResourceQuota:
          configuration:
            apiVersion: resourcequota.admission.k8s.io/v1alpha1
            kind: Configuration
            limitedResources:
            - resource: persistentvolumeclaims
            matchContains:
            - gold.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage
    # ...
    ```

    where:

    `configuration.resource`
    :   Specifies the group or resource whose consumption is limited by default.

`configuration.matchContains`
:   Specifies the name of the resource tracked by quota associated with the group or resource to limit by default.

## Limit ranges in a LimitRange object  { #admin-quota-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

To define compute resource constraints at the object level, create a `LimitRange` object. By creating this object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an individual pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

All requests to create and modify resources are evaluated against each `LimitRange` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, the resource is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, the default value is applied to the resource.

For CPU and memory limits, if you specify a maximum value but do not specify a minimum limit, the resource can consume more CPU and memory resources than the maximum value.

### Container limits { #container-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a container can consume.

The following list shows resources that a container can consume:

- CPU
- Memory

The following table shows the supported constraints for a container. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each container.

**Supported constraints**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Constraint</th>
  <th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Min</code></td>
  <td><code>Min[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>container/resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (optional)<br><br>If the configuration defines a <code>min</code> CPU, the request value must be greater than the CPU value. If you do not set a <code>min</code> value or you set <code>min</code> to <code>0</code>, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the <code>max</code> value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>Max</code></td>
  <td><code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>Max[&lt;resource&gt;]</code><br><br>If the configuration defines a <code>max</code> CPU, you do not need to define a CPU request value. However, you must set a limit that satisfies the maximum CPU constraint that is specified in the limit range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio</code></td>
  <td><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to (<code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> / <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code>)<br><br>If the limit range defines a <code>maxLimitRequestRatio</code> constraint, any new containers must have both a <code>request</code> and a <code>limit</code> value. Additionally, OpenShift Container Platform calculates a limit-to-request ratio by dividing the <code>limit</code> by the <code>request</code>. The result should be an integer greater than 1.<br><br>For example, if a container has <code>cpu: 500</code> in the <code>limit</code> value, and <code>cpu: 100</code> in the <code>request</code> value, the limit-to-request ratio for <code>cpu</code> is <code>5</code>. This ratio must be less than or equal to the <code>maxLimitRequestRatio</code>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The following list shows default resources that a container can consume:

- `Default[<resource>]`: Defaults `container.resources.limit[<resource>]` to specified value if none.
- `Default Requests[<resource>]`: Defaults `container.resources.requests[<resource>]` to specified value if none.

### Pod limits { #pod-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a pod can consume.

A pod can consume the following resources:

- CPU
- Memory

The following table shows the supported constraints for a pod. Across all pods, the following behavior must hold true:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Constraint</th>
  <th>Enforced behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Min</code></td>
  <td><code>Min[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code>. If you do not set a <code>min</code> value or you set <code>min</code> to <code>0</code>, the result is no limit and the pod can consume more of the resource than the <code>max</code> value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>Max</code></td>
  <td><code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> (required) less than or equal to <code>Max[&lt;resource&gt;]</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio</code></td>
  <td><code>MaxLimitRequestRatio[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> less than or equal to (<code>container.resources.limits[&lt;resource&gt;]</code> / <code>container.resources.requests[&lt;resource&gt;]</code>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Image limits { #image-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image can consume.

An image can consume the following resources:

- Storage
- `openshift.io/Image`

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image.

**Image limits**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Constraint</th>
  <th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Max</code></td>
  <td><code>image.dockerimagemetadata.size</code> less than or equal to <code>Max[&lt;resource&gt;]</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


!!! note

    To prevent blobs that exceed the limit from being uploaded to the registry, you must configure the registry to enforce quota. The `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA` environment variable must be set to `true`. By default, the environment variable is set to `true` for new deployments.

### Image stream limits { #image-stream-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that an image stream can consume.

An image stream can consume the following resources:

- `openshift.io/image-tags`
- `openshift.io/images`
- `openshift.io/ImageStream`

The `openshift.io/image-tags` limit bounds unique references derived from tag definitions in the `imagestream.spec.tags` resource. A reference can be an `ImageStreamTag`, an `ImageStreamImage`, or a `DockerImage`. You can use the `oc tag` and `oc import-image` commands to create tags. Internal and external references are not distinguished, and each unique reference in the spec is counted once. Updates that would exceed the limit are rejected, including updates from pushes to the internal registry that add or change tag definitions.

The `openshift.io/images` limit bounds unique image identities recorded in `imagestream.status.tags`. The name is equivalent to the digest for the image. It limits how many distinct images the stream can reference in status, including from registry pushes. Internal and external references are not distinguished.

!!! warning

    Do not read `openshift.io/image-tags` and `openshift.io/images` as "tag names versus images per tag." The first limit is computed from the `ImageStream` `spec.tags` resource. The second is computed from the `imagestream.status.tags` resource. Both limits can cause image stream updates to fail when a push or other operation would exceed them.

The following table shows the supported constraints for an image stream. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each image stream.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Constraint</th>
  <th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Max[openshift.io/image-tags]</code></td>
  <td><code>length( uniqueimagetags( imagestream.spec.tags ) )</code> less than or equal to <code>Max[openshift.io/image-tags]</code><br><br><code>uniqueimagetags</code> returns unique references to images of given spec tags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>Max[openshift.io/images]</code></td>
  <td><code>length( uniqueimages( imagestream.status.tags ) )</code> less than or equal to <code>Max[openshift.io/images]</code><br><br><code>uniqueimages</code> returns unique image names found in status tags. The name is equal to the digest for the image.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### PersistentVolumeClaim limits { #persistent-volume-claim-limits_using-quotas-and-limit-ranges }

After you create the `LimitRange` object, you can specify the exact amount of resources that a `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource can consume.

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` resource can consume storage resources.

The following table shows the supported constraints for a persistent volume claim. If specified, the constraints must hold true for each persistent volume claim.

**`PersistentVolumeClaim` resource limits**

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Constraint</th>
  <th>Enforced behavior</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>Min</code></td>
  <td>Min[<resource>] +<=+ claim.spec.resources.requests[<resource>] (required)</td>
