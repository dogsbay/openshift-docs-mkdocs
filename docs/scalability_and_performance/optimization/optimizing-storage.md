# Optimizing storage { #optimizing-storage }

Optimizing storage helps to minimize storage use across all resources. As an administrator, you can optimize storage to ensure that existing storage resources are working in an efficient manner.

## Available persistent storage options { #available-persistent-storage-options_persistent-storage }

To optimize your OpenShift Container Platform environment, review the available persistent storage options. By understanding these choices, you can select the appropriate storage configuration to meet your specific workload requirements.

## Recommended configurable storage technology { #recommended-configurable-storage-technology_persistent-storage }

Review the recommended and configurable storage technologies for the given OpenShift Container Platform cluster application.

**Recommended and configurable storage technology**

| Storage type          | Block            | File             | Object           |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| ROX                   | Yes              | Yes              | Yes              |
| RWX                   | No               | Yes              | Yes              |
| Registry              | Configurable     | Configurable     | Recommended      |
| Scaled registry       | Not configurable | Configurable     | Recommended      |
| Metrics               | Recommended      | Configurable     | Not configurable |
| Elasticsearch Logging | Recommended      | Configurable     | Not supported    |
| Loki Logging          | Not configurable | Not configurable | Recommended      |
| Apps                  | Recommended      | Recommended      | Not configurable |

where:

`ROX`
:   Specifies `ReadOnlyMany` access mode.

`ROX.Yes`
:   Specifies that this access mode

`RWX`
:   Specifies `ReadWriteMany` access mode.

`Metrics`
:   Specifies Prometheus as the underlying technology used for metrics.

`Metrics.Configurable`
:   For metrics, using file storage with the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode is unreliable. If you use file storage, do not configure the RWX access mode on any persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are configured for use with metrics.

`Elasticsearch Logging.Configurable`
:   For logging, review the recommended storage solution in Configuring persistent storage for the log store section. Using NFS storage as a persistent volume or through NAS, such as Gluster, can corrupt the data. Therefore, NFS is not supported for Elasticsearch storage and LokiStack log store in OpenShift Container Platform Logging. You must use one persistent volume type per log store.

`Apps.Not configurable`
:   Specifies that object storage is not consumed through PVs or PVCs of OpenShift Container Platform. Apps must integrate with the object storage REST API.

!!! note

    A scaled registry is an OpenShift image registry where two or more pod replicas are running.

### Specific application storage recommendations { #specific-application-storage-recommendations_persistent-storage }

Review the specific storage recommendations for registries, scaled registries, metrics, logs, and applications to better understand the storage requirements for each of these entities.

!!! warning

    Testing shows issues with using the NFS server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as a storage backend for core services. This includes the OpenShift Container Registry and Quay, Prometheus for monitoring storage, and Elasticsearch for logging storage. Therefore, using RHEL NFS to back PVs used by core services is not recommended.

    Other NFS implementations in the marketplace might not have these issues. Contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any testing that was possibly completed against these OpenShift Container Platform core components.

Registry
:   In a non-scaled/high-availability (HA) OpenShift image registry cluster deployment:

    - The storage technology does not have to support RWX access mode.
    - The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
    - The preferred storage technology is object storage followed by block storage.
    - File storage is not recommended for OpenShift image registry cluster deployment with production workloads.

Scaled registry
:   In a scaled/HA OpenShift image registry cluster deployment:

    - The storage technology must support RWX access mode.
    - The storage technology must ensure read-after-write consistency.
    - The preferred storage technology is object storage.
    - Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, and OpenStack Swift are supported.
    - Object storage should be S3 or Swift compliant.
    - For non-cloud platforms, such as vSphere and bare-metal installations, the only configurable technology is file storage.
    - Block storage is not configurable.
    - The use of Network File System (NFS) storage with OpenShift Container Platform is supported. However, the use of NFS storage with a scaled registry can cause known issues. For more information, see the "Is NFS supported for OpenShift cluster internal components in Production?" Red Hat Knowledgebase solution.

Metrics
:   In an OpenShift Container Platform hosted metrics cluster deployment:

    - The preferred storage technology is block storage.
    - Object storage is not configurable.

!!! warning

    It is not recommended to use file storage for a hosted metrics cluster deployment with production workloads.

Logging
:   In an OpenShift Container Platform hosted logging cluster deployment:

    - Loki Operator:

        - The preferred storage technology is S3 compatible Object storage.
        - Block storage is not configurable.

- OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator:

    - The preferred storage technology is block storage.
    - Object storage is not supported.

    !!! note

        As of logging version 5.4.3 the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator is deprecated and is planned to be removed in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to using the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator to manage the default log storage, you can use the Loki Operator.

    Applications
    :   Application use cases vary from application to application, as described in the following examples:

- Storage technologies that support dynamic PV provisioning have low mount time latencies, and are not tied to nodes to support a healthy cluster.

- Application developers are responsible for knowing and understanding the storage requirements for their application, and how it works with the provided storage to ensure that issues do not occur when an application scales or interacts with the storage layer.

*   Red&#160;Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) Cinder: RHOSP Cinder tends to be adept at ROX access mode use cases.
*   Databases: Databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL DBs, etc.) tend to perform best with dedicated block storage.
*   The etcd database must have enough storage and adequate performance capacity to enable a large cluster. Information about monitoring and benchmarking tools to establish ample storage and a high-performance environment is described in _Recommended etcd practices_.

## Data storage management { #data-storage-management_persistent-storage }

To effectively manage data storage in OpenShift Container Platform, review the main directories where components write data.

The following table summarizes the main directories that OpenShift Container Platform components write data to.

## Optimizing storage performance for Microsoft Azure { #optimizing-storage-azure_persistent-storage }

To ensure optimal cluster performance on Microsoft Azure, configure faster storage for OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes. Red Hat recommends faster storage, particularly for etcd on the control plane nodes.

For production Azure clusters and clusters with intensive workloads, the virtual machine operating system disk for control plane machines should be able to sustain a tested and recommended minimum throughput of 5000 IOPS / 200 MBps. This throughput can be provided by having a minimum of 1 TiB Premium SSD (P30). In Azure and Azure Stack Hub, disk performance is directly dependent on SSD disk sizes. To achieve the throughput supported by a `Standard_D8s_v3` virtual machine, or other similar machine types, and the target of 5000 IOPS, at least a P30 disk is required.

Host caching must be set to `ReadOnly` for low latency and high IOPS and throughput when reading data. Reading data from the cache, which is present either in the VM memory or in the local SSD disk, is much faster than reading from the disk, which is in the blob storage.
