# Cluster maintenance { #troubleshooting-cluster-maintenance }

When deploying OpenShift Container Platform on bare-metal infrastructure, you must pay more attention to certain configurations which can have a significant impact on cluster stability. You can troubleshoot more effectively by completing these tasks:

- Monitor for failed or failing hardware components
- Periodically check the status of the cluster Operators

!!! note

    For hardware monitoring, contact your hardware vendor to find the appropriate logging tool for your specific hardware.

## Checking cluster Operators { #troubleshooting-clusters-check-cluster-operators_troubleshooting-cluster-maintenance }

Periodically check the status of your cluster Operators to find issues early.

**Procedure**

- Check the status of the cluster Operators by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get co
    ```

## Watching for failed pods { #troubleshooting-clusters-check-for-failed-pods_troubleshooting-cluster-maintenance }

To reduce troubleshooting time, regularly monitor for failed pods in your cluster.

**Procedure**

- To watch for failed pods, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get po -A | grep -Eiv 'complete|running'
    ```
