title: Creating a project as another user

# Creating a project as another user { #creating-project-other-user }

You can use impersonation to create a project on behalf of a different user account.

## API impersonation { #authentication-api-impersonation_creating-project-other-user }

You can configure API requests in OpenShift Container Platform to act as another user. Impersonation allows you to perform actions on behalf of another account without switching credentials.

## Impersonating a user when you create a project { #impersonation-project-creation_creating-project-other-user }

You can impersonate a different user when you create a project request. Because `system:authenticated:oauth` is the only bootstrap group that can create project requests, you must impersonate that group.

**Procedure**

- To create a project request on behalf of a different user:

    ```terminal
    $ oc new-project <project> --as=<user> \
        --as-group=system:authenticated --as-group=system:authenticated:oauth
    ```
