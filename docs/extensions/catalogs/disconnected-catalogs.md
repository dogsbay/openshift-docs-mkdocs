title: Disconnected environment support in OLM v1

# Disconnected environment support in OLM v1 { #disconnected-catalogs }

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) v1 supports cluster extension lifecycle management in internet-disconnected environments. This feature helps cluster administrators run mission-critical production workloads in high-security, disconnected clusters.

## About disconnected support and the oc-mirror plugin in OLM v1 { #olmv1-about-disconnected_disconnected-catalogs }

After you use the oc-mirror plugin for the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to mirror images to a mirror registry, OLM v1 relies on specific resource sets to function.

Depending on your oc-mirror plugin version, OLM v1 uses one of the following resource sets:

oc-mirror plugin v1
:   Automatically generates `ImageContentSourcePolicy` resources and requires manually created `ClusterCatalog` resources.

oc-mirror plugin v2
:   Automatically generates `ImageDigestMirrorSet`, `ImageTagMirrorSet`, and `ClusterCatalog` resources.

!!! note

    The oc-mirror plugin v2 is the recommended version for mirroring.
