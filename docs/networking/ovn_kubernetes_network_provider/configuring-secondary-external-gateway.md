# Configure an external gateway on the default network { #configuring-secondary-external-gateway }

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an external gateway on the default network.

This feature offers the following benefits:

- Granular control over egress traffic on a per-namespace basis
- Flexible configuration of static and dynamic external gateway IP addresses
- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families

## Prerequisites { #configuring-secondary-external-gateway_prerequisites }

- Your cluster uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin.
- Your infrastructure is configured to route traffic from the secondary external gateway.

## How OpenShift Container Platform determines the external gateway IP address { #nw-secondary-ext-gw-about_configuring-secondary-external-gateway }

You configure a secondary external gateway with the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` custom resource (CR) from the `k8s.ovn.org` API group. The CR supports static and dynamic approaches for specifying an IP address for an external gateway.

Each namespace that an `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR targets cannot be selected by any other `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR. A namespace cannot have concurrent secondary external gateways.

Changes to policies are isolated in the controller. If a policy fails to apply, changes to other policies do not trigger a retry of other policies. Policies are re-evaluated when updates occur to the policy or to related objects such as target namespaces, pod gateways, or the namespaces that host them from dynamic hops. When re-evaluated, the policy applies any differences from the changes.

Static assignment
:   You specify an IP address directly.

Dynamic assignment
:   You specify an IP address indirectly, with namespace and pod selectors, and an optional network attachment definition.

!!! warning

    If the name of a network attachment definition is provided, the external gateway IP address of the network attachment is used.

    If the name of a network attachment definition is not provided, the external gateway IP address for the pod itself is used. However, this approach works only if the pod is configured with `hostNetwork` set to `true`.

## AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configuration { #nw-secondary-ext-gw-object_configuring-secondary-external-gateway }

You can define an `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object, which is cluster scoped, with specific properties.

A namespace can be selected by only one `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` CR at a time.

The following tables detail supported fields for objects.

**`AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object**

If a namespace is selected by more than one <code>AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute</code> CR, a <code>failed</code> error status occurs on the second and subsequent CRs that target the same namespace.

## Example secondary external gateway configurations { #example-secondary-external-gateway-configurations_configuring-secondary-external-gateway }

Reference the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` objects to better understand secondary external gateway configurations.

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures two static IP addresses as external gateways for pods in namespaces with the `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059` label:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: default-route-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: novxlan-externalgw-ecmp-4059
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
# ...
```

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures a dynamic external gateway. The IP addresses used for the external gateway are derived from the additional network attachments associated with each of the selected pods.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: shadow-traffic-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        externalTraffic: ""
  nextHops:
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          shadowTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: shadow-gateway
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gigabyteGW: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayNamespace: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gateway
# ...
```

In the following example, the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object configures both static and dynamic external gateways:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.ovn.org/v1
kind: AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute
metadata:
  name: multi-hop-policy
spec:
  from:
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        trafficType: "egress"
  nextHops:
    static:
    - ip: "172.18.0.8"
    - ip: "172.18.0.9"
    dynamic:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          gatewayPod: ""
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          egressTraffic: ""
      networkAttachmentName: gigabyte
# ...
```

## Configure a secondary external gateway { #nw-secondary-ext-gw-configure_configuring-secondary-external-gateway }

You can configure an external gateway on the default network for a namespace in your cluster.

**Prerequisites**

- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You are logged in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file that contains an `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object. For more information, see "AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute object configuration".

2. To create an admin policy based external route, enter the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file>.yaml
    ```

    - `<file>`: Specifies the name of the YAML file that you created in a previous step.

        ```text title="Example output"
        adminpolicybasedexternalroute.k8s.ovn.org/default-route-policy created
        ```

3. To confirm that the admin policy based external route was created, enter the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe apbexternalroute <name> | tail -n 6
    ```

    - `<name>`: Specifies the name of the `AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute` object.

        ```text title="Example output"
        Status:
          Last Transition Time:  2023-04-24T15:09:01Z
          Messages:
          Configured external gateway IPs: 172.18.0.8
          Status:  Success
        Events:  <none>
        ```
