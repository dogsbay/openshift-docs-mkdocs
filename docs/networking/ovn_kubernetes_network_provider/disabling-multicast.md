# Disabling multicast for a project { #nw-ovn-kubernetes-disabling-multicast }

In OpenShift Container Platform with OVN-Kubernetes, you can disable IP multicast on a per-project basis so pods no longer receive multicast traffic.

## Disabling multicast between pods { #nw-disabling-multicast_ovn-kubernetes-disabling-multicast }

To disable multicast between pods in a project, you can remove the `k8s.ovn.org/multicast-enabled` annotation from the namespace by using the `oc annotate` command or a namespace manifest.

**Prerequisites**

- Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You must log in to the cluster with a user that has the `cluster-admin` role.

**Procedure**

- Disable multicast by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc annotate namespace <namespace> \
        k8s.ovn.org/multicast-enabled-
    ```

    For `<namespace>`, specify the namespace for the project you want to disable multicast for.

    !!! tip

        You can alternatively apply the following YAML to delete the annotation:

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
          name: <namespace>
          annotations:
            k8s.ovn.org/multicast-enabled: null
        ```
