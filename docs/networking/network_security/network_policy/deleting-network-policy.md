# Deleting a network policy { #deleting-network-policy }

As a cluster administrator, you can delete a network policy from a namespace.

## Delete a network policy using the CLI { #nw-networkpolicy-delete-cli_deleting-network-policy }

You can delete a network policy in a namespace.

!!! note

    If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can delete network policies in any namespace in the cluster.

!!! note

    If you log in with `cluster-admin` privileges, you can delete network policies in any namespace in the cluster. In the web console, you can delete policies directly in YAML or by using the **Actions** menu.

**Prerequisites**

- Your cluster uses a network plugin that supports `NetworkPolicy` objects, such as the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, with `mode: NetworkPolicy` set.
- You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You logged in to the cluster with a user with `admin` privileges.
- You are working in the namespace where the network policy exists.

**Procedure**

- To delete a network policy object, enter the following command. Successful output lists the name of the policy object and the `deleted` status.

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete networkpolicy <policy_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    where:

    `<policy_name>`
    :   Specifies the name of the network policy.

    `<namespace>`
    :   Optional parameter. If you defined the object in a different namespace than the current namespace, the parameter specifices the namespace.
