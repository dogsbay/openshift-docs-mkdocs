title: Local storage overview

# Local storage overview { #ways-to-provision-local-storage_{context} }

Local storage provides direct access to disks attached to cluster nodes, delivering lower latency and higher throughput than network-attached or cloud-based storage. Use local storage for performance-sensitive workloads, single-node clusters, or environments without cloud storage infrastructure.

## Overview of local storage options { #persistent-storage-local-top-level-overview_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

OpenShift Container Platform provides three solutions for provisioning node-local storage. Each offers different capabilities for dynamic provisioning and topology awareness. Node-local storage binds workloads to specific nodes.

You can use any of the following solutions to provision local storage:

- HostPath Provisioner (HPP)
- Local Storage Operator (LSO)
- Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage

!!! warning

    These solutions support provisioning only node-local storage. The workloads are bound to the nodes that provide the storage. If the node becomes unavailable, the workload also becomes unavailable. To maintain workload availability despite node failures, you must ensure storage data replication through active or passive replication mechanisms.

### Overview of HostPath Provisioner functionality { #overview-of-hpp-functionality_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

You can perform the following actions using HostPath Provisioner (HPP):

- Map the host filesystem paths to storage classes for provisioning local storage.
- Statically create storage classes to configure filesystem paths on a node for storage consumption.
- Statically provision Persistent Volumes (PVs) based on the storage class.
- Create workloads and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) while being aware of the underlying storage topology.

!!! note

    HPP is available in upstream Kubernetes. However, it is not recommended to use HPP from upstream Kubernetes.

### Overview of Local Storage Operator functionality { #overview-of-lso-functionality_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

You can perform the following actions using Local Storage Operator (LSO):

- Assign the storage devices (disks or partitions) to the storage classes without modifying the device configuration.
- Statically provision PVs and storage classes by configuring the `LocalVolume` custom resource (CR).
- Create workloads and PVCs while being aware of the underlying storage topology.

!!! note

    LSO is developed and delivered by Red Hat.

### Overview of LVM Storage functionality { #overview-of-lvm-storage-functionality_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

You can perform the following actions using Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage:

- Configure storage devices (disks or partitions) as lvm2 volume groups and expose the volume groups as storage classes.
- Create workloads and request storage by using PVCs without considering the node topology.

LVM Storage uses the TopoLVM CSI driver to dynamically allocate storage space to the nodes in the topology and provision PVs.

!!! note

    LVM Storage is developed and maintained by Red Hat. The CSI driver provided with LVM Storage is the upstream project "topolvm".

## Comparison of LVM Storage, LSO, and HPP { #comparison-of-solutions-to-provision-node-local-storage_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

Compare LVM Storage, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) across storage types, core features, performance, and isolation to determine the best local storage provisioning solution for your cluster.

### Comparison of the support for storage types and filesystems { #comparing-storage-types_ways-to-provision-local-storage }

The following table compares the support for storage types and filesystems provided by LVM Storage, Local Storage Operator (LSO), and HostPath Provisioner (HPP) to provision local storage:

1. None of the solutions (LVM Storage, LSO, and HPP) provide support for object storage. Therefore, if you want to use object storage, you need an S3 object storage solution, such as `MultiClusterGateway` from the Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation. All of the solutions can serve as underlying storage providers for the S3 object storage solutions.
