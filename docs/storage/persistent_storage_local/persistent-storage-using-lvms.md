# Persistent storage using logical volume manager storage { #persistent-storage-using-lvms }

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage uses LVM2 through the `TopoLVM CSI` driver to dynamically provision local storage on a cluster with limited resources. With LVM Storage, you can create volume groups, persistent volume claims (PVCs), snapshots, and clones.

## Logical Volume Manager Storage installation { #lvms-about-lvm-storage-installation_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can install LVM Storage on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster and configure it to dynamically provision storage for your workloads.

You can install LVM Storage by using the OpenShift Container Platform CLI (`oc`), OpenShift Container Platform web console, or Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

!!! warning

    When using LVM Storage on multi-node clusters, LVM Storage only supports provisioning local storage. LVM Storage does not support storage data replication mechanisms across nodes. You must ensure storage data replication through active or passive replication mechanisms to avoid a single point of failure.

### Prerequisites to install LVM Storage { #lvms-deployment-requirements-for-sno-ran_logical-volume-manager-storage }

The prerequisites to install LVM Storage are as follows:

- Ensure that you have a minimum of 10 milliCPU and 100 MiB of RAM.

- Ensure that every managed cluster has dedicated disks that are used to provision storage. LVM Storage uses only those disks that are empty and do not contain file system signatures. To ensure that the disks are empty and do not contain file system signatures, wipe the disks before using them.

- Before installing LVM Storage in a private CI environment where you can reuse the storage devices that you configured in the previous LVM Storage installation, ensure that you have wiped the disks that are not in use. If you do not wipe the disks before installing LVM Storage, you cannot reuse the disks without manual intervention.

    !!! note

        You cannot wipe the disks that are in use.

- If you want to install LVM Storage by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), ensure that you have installed RHACM on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. For more information, see "Installing LVM Storage by using RHACM".

### Installing LVM Storage by using the CLI { #install-lvms-operator-cli_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can install LVM Storage by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to dynamically provision local storage on clusters with limited resources.

!!! note

    The default namespace for the LVM Storage Operator is `openshift-lvm-storage`.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` and Operator installation permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Create a YAML file with the configuration for creating a namespace:

    ```yaml title="Example YAML configuration for creating a namespace"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      labels:
        openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
        pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
        pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: privileged
        pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: privileged
      name: openshift-lvm-storage
    ```

2. Create the namespace by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name>
    ```

3. Create an `OperatorGroup` CR YAML file:

    ```yaml title="Example OperatorGroup CR"
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
    kind: OperatorGroup
    metadata:
      name: openshift-storage-operatorgroup
      namespace: openshift-lvm-storage
    spec:
      targetNamespaces:
      - openshift-storage
    ```

4. Create the `OperatorGroup` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> 
    ```

5. Create a `Subscription` CR YAML file:

    ```yaml title="Example Subscription CR"
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      name: lvms
      namespace: openshift-lvm-storage
    spec:
      installPlanApproval: Automatic
      name: lvms-operator
      source: redhat-operators
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    ```

6. Create the `Subscription` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> 
    ```

**Verification**

1. To verify that LVM Storage is installed, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get csv -n openshift-lvm-storage -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Name                         Phase
    4.13.0-202301261535          Succeeded
    ```

### Installing LVM Storage by using the web console { #lvms-installing-lvms-with-web-console_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Install LVM Storage from the OpenShift Container Platform web console to dynamically provision local storage on clusters with limited resources.

!!! note

    The default namespace for the LVM Storage Operator is `openshift-lvm-storage`.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the cluster.
- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform with `cluster-admin` and Operator installation permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

2. Click **Ecosystem** → **Software Catalog**.

3. Click **LVM Storage** on the software catalog page.

4. Set the following options on the **Operator Installation** page:

    1. **Update Channel** as **stable-4.22**.

    2. **Installation Mode** as **A specific namespace on the cluster**.

    3. **Installed Namespace** as **Operator recommended namespace openshift-storage**. If the `openshift-lvm-storage` namespace does not exist, it is created during the operator installation.

    4. **Update approval** as **Automatic** or **Manual**.

        !!! note

            If you select **Automatic** updates, the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates the running instance of LVM Storage without any intervention.

            If you select **Manual** updates, the OLM creates an update request. As a cluster administrator, you must manually approve the update request to update LVM Storage to a newer version.

5. Optional: Select the **Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace** checkbox.

6. Click **Install**.

**Verification**

- Verify that LVM Storage shows a green tick, indicating successful installation.

### Installing LVM Storage in a disconnected environment { #lvms-installing-lvms-disconnected-env_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Install LVM Storage in a disconnected environment where your cluster has no internet access, such as air-gapped networks, high-security facilities, or regulated industries requiring network isolation for security and compliance.

**Prerequisites**

- You read "About disconnected installation mirroring".
- You have access to the OpenShift Container Platform image repository.
- You created a mirror registry (see "Creating a mirror registry with mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift").

**Procedure**

1. Follow the steps in the "Creating the image set configuration" procedure. To create an `ImageSetConfiguration` custom resource (CR) for LVM Storage, you can use the following example `ImageSetConfiguration` CR configuration:

    ```yaml title="Example ImageSetConfiguration CR for LVM Storage"
    kind: ImageSetConfiguration
    apiVersion: mirror.openshift.io/v1alpha2
    archiveSize: 4
    storageConfig:
      registry:
        imageURL: example.com/mirror/oc-mirror-metadata
        skipTLS: false
    mirror:
      platform:
        channels:
        - name: stable-4.22
          type: ocp
        graph: true
      operators:
      - catalog: registry.redhat.io/redhat/redhat-operator-index:v4.22
        packages:
        - name: lvms-operator
          channels:
          - name: stable
      additionalImages:
      - name: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
      helm: {}
    ```

    - `archiveSize`: Specifies the maximum size (in GiB) of each file within the image set.
    - `storageConfig`: Specifies the location in which you want to save the image set. This location can be a registry or a local directory. You must configure the `storageConfig` field unless you are using the Technology Preview OCI feature.
    - `storageConfig.registry.imageURL`: Specifies the storage URL for the image stream when using a registry. For more information, see "Why use imagestreams".
    - `mirror.platform.name`: Specifies the channel from which you want to retrieve the OpenShift Container Platform images.
    - `mirror.platform.channels[].name`: Set this field to `true` to generate the OpenShift Update Service (OSUS) graph image. For more information, see "About the OpenShift Update Service".
    - `mirror.operators.catalog`: Specifies the Operator catalog from which you want to retrieve the OpenShift Container Platform images.
    - `mirror.operators.packages.name`: Specifies the Operator packages to include in the image set. If this field is empty, all packages in the catalog are retrieved.
    - `mirror.operators[].packages[].channels.name`: Specifies the channels of the Operator packages to include in the image set. You must include the default channel for the Operator package even if you do not use the bundles in that channel. You can find the default channel by running the following command: `$ oc mirror list operators --catalog=<catalog_name> --package=<package_name>`.
    - `mirror.additionalImages.name`: Specifies any additional images to include in the image set.

2. Follow the procedure in "Mirroring an image set to a mirror registry".

3. Follow the procedure in "Configuring image registry repository mirroring".

### Installing LVM Storage by using RHACM { #lvms-installing-odf-logical-volume-manager-operator-using-rhacm_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To install LVM Storage on clusters by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM), you must create a `Policy` custom resource (CR) and configure the criteria to select the target clusters.

!!! note

    The `Policy` CR that is created to install LVM Storage is also applied to the clusters that are imported or created after creating the `Policy` CR.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the RHACM cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` and Operator installation permissions.
- You have dedicated disks that LVM Storage can use on each cluster.
- The cluster must be managed by RHACM.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the RHACM CLI using your OpenShift Container Platform credentials.

2. Create a namespace.

    ```terminal
    $ oc create ns <namespace>
    ```

3. Create a `Policy` CR YAML file:

    ```yaml title="Example Policy CR to install and configure LVM Storage"

4. Create the `Policy` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    Upon creating the `Policy` CR, the following custom resources are created on the clusters that match the selection criteria configured in the `PlacementRule` CR:

    - `Namespace`

    - `OperatorGroup`

    - `Subscription`

        !!! note

            The default namespace for the LVM Storage Operator is `openshift-lvm-storage`.

## Static and dynamic device discovery in LVM Storage { #static-and-dynamic-device-discovery-in-lvms_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can use static or dynamic discovery policies to manage how block devices join your volume groups. Selecting the appropriate policy helps you automate storage expansion safely or preserve a locked, predictable storage footprint over time.

Static
:   The Operator creates the volume group by using devices it finds at installation time. The Operator ignores devices discovered after the volume group exists.

    Static discovery is the default policy for new volume groups. It eliminates operational risk by locking the device set after the Operator creates the volume group.

    Combined with explicit device paths, it provides a fully deterministic storage configuration.

    Without explicit paths, the Operator discovers devices only at creation time and then stops the set.

Dynamic
:   The Operator continuously discovers and adds devices to the volume group on each reconciliation cycle.

    Dynamic discovery remains the default for existing volume groups where the policy field is nil to maintain backward compatibility.

    However, this policy can lead to unexpected behavior in production environments. Devices that appear after the initial setup because of hardware changes, driver reloads, or kernel device renaming are automatically added to the volume group.

    This creates operational risk because the volume group composition becomes non-deterministic and depends on the runtime state of the node rather than explicit administrator intent.

!!! note

    The Operator adds the `DeviceDiscoveryPolicy` field to the `DeviceClass` specification. If you explicitly set device paths in `deviceSelector.paths` or `deviceSelector.optionalPaths`, the cluster always uses those exact paths, and ignores your discovery policy setting.

The cluster status reports the effective policy by using `DeviceDiscoveryPolicyStatus`, which distinguishes three runtime states:

**Effective policy status values**

| Status value     | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Preconfigured`  | Explicit device paths configuration by using `deviceSelector`. Discovery policy is not applicable.   |
| `RuntimeDynamic` | No explicit paths. Discovery policy is Dynamic. The Operator continuously discovers devices.         |
| `RuntimeStatic`  | No explicit paths. Discovery policy is Static. The Operator discovers devices once at creation time. |

The following table shows the behavior matrix:

**Device discovery behavior by configuration**

| Explicit paths | Discovery policy            | Effective behavior                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes            | Any / nil                   | `Preconfigured`: The Operator honors the specified paths and ignores the discovery policy.     |
| No             | `Static`                    | `RuntimeStatic`: The Operator locks the device set immediately after creating the volume group |
| No             | `Dynamic`                   | `RuntimeDynamic`: continuous discovery every 30 seconds                                        |
| No             | nil (new volume group)      | `RuntimeStatic`: defaults to Static                                                            |
| No             | nil (existing volume group) | `RuntimeDynamic`: defaults to Dynamic for backward compatibility                               |

### Static mode enforcement { #static-mode-enforcement_logical-volume-manager-storage }

In static mode, the system locks the device set after initial discovery. If a volume group lacks explicit paths, newly attached devices are automatically excluded to prevent unintended volume expansions.

This strict filtering behavior does not apply during the very first reconciliation cycle. During this initial pass, the Operator discovers all available devices to successfully create the volume group. Once created, the Operator locks the device set during all subsequent reconciliations.

The discovery policy also controls whether the controller re-queues for periodic device scanning:

**Requeue behavior by configuration**

| Configuration                  | Periodic requeue                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit paths                 | No: paths define the exact device set; changes trigger reconciliation by using the `LVMVolumeGroup` watch |
| Dynamic without explicit paths | Yes: every 30 seconds                                                                                     |
| Static without explicit paths  | No: device set is locked after creation                                                                   |

### Validation rules for device discovery policy { #validation-rules-for-device-discovery-policy_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To ensure your storage cluster deploys successfully and avoids misconfiguration errors, the validating webhook enforces strict rules when you create or update an `LVMCluster` custom resource.

Creation
:   - If you define one device class without paths, a webhook warning appears. Avoid the default `Static` policy in production. Set `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` explicitly.
    - If multiple device classes are defined, every device class must specify device paths. Auto-discovery without paths is not allowed with many device classes. The cluster cannot determine which devices belong to which class.
    - If the `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` is empty and paths are missing, a webhook warning appears. Administrators must define the policy explicitly.

Updates
:   No specific update restrictions apply to the `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` field. You can change it at any time.

The following table shows how the device discovery policy feature interacts with other features:

**Device discovery policy feature interactions**

| Feature                             | Interaction                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData` | Works independently of the discovery policy. Devices are wiped before being added to the volume group, regardless of how they were discovered. |
| Node selector                       | Works independently. The discovery policy applies only to the set of devices found on nodes matching the selector.                             |

### LVMCluster custom resource examples { #lvm-cluster-custom-resource-examples_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can configure the `deviceDiscoveryPolicy` field in your `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) by using these examples to meet your specific storage requirements.

Explicit device paths (recommended for production)
:   ```yaml
    apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
    kind: LVMCluster
    metadata:
      name: my-lvmcluster
    spec:
      storage:
        deviceClasses:
        - name: vg1
          deviceSelector:
            paths:
            - /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_VBOX_HARDDISK_VB12345678-90abcdef
            - /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-SATA_VBOX_HARDDISK_VBabcdef01-23456789
          thinPoolConfig:
            name: thin-pool-1
            sizePercent: 90
    ```

    The discovery policy is not relevant here. Explicit paths always define the device set.

Static discovery without explicit paths
:   ```yaml
    apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
    kind: LVMCluster
    metadata:
      name: my-lvmcluster
    spec:
      storage:
        deviceClasses:
        - name: vg1
          deviceDiscoveryPolicy: Static
          thinPoolConfig:
            name: thin-pool-1
            sizePercent: 90
    ```

    The Operator discovers and adds all available devices to the volume group during the initial reconciliation. After the Operator creates the volume group, it adds no new devices.

Dynamic discovery without explicit paths (not recommended for production)
:   ```yaml
    apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
    kind: LVMCluster
    metadata:
      name: my-lvmcluster
    spec:
      storage:
        deviceClasses:
        - name: vg1
          deviceDiscoveryPolicy: Dynamic
          thinPoolConfig:
            name: thin-pool-1
            sizePercent: 90
    ```

    The Operator continuously discovers and adds devices to the volume group every 30 seconds. This setting is useful for development and testing. However, it might introduce operational risks in production environments.

To view a list of excluded devices and the reason for their exclusion, use the `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` custom resource (CR).  

If static device discovery excludes a device, the status report displays the error in the following format:

```text
<device> was not part of <vg_name> at creation (static device discovery enabled)
```

The `VGStatus.DeviceDiscoveryPolicy` parameter reports the effective discovery policy as one of the following values:

- `Preconfigured`
- `RuntimeDynamic`
- `RuntimeStatic`.

## About the LVMCluster custom resource { #about-lvmcluster_logical-volume-manager-storage }

The `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) is the primary configuration for LVM Storage deployment, defining how storage is provisioned across your cluster by specifying volume groups, devices, node selection, and thin pool settings to meet your workload requirements.

You can configure the `LVMCluster` CR to perform the following actions:

- Create LVM volume groups that you can use to provision persistent volume claims (PVCs).
- Configure a list of devices that you want to add to the LVM volume groups.
- Configure the requirements to select the nodes on which you want to create an LVM volume group, and the thin pool configuration for the volume group.
- Force wipe the selected devices.

After you have installed LVM Storage, you must create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

### Limitations to configure the size of the devices used in LVM Storage { #limitations-to-configure-size-of-devices_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To ensure your devices are compatible with storage operations, review the size configuration limitations in LVM Storage. Adhering to these constraints prevents provisioning failures by ensuring selected devices meet the required capacity specifications.

When provisioning storage by using LVM Storage, the following factors limit device size:

- The total storage size that you can provision is limited by the size of the underlying Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the over-provisioning factor.

- The size of the logical volume depends on the size of the Physical Extent (PE) and the Logical Extent (LE).

    - You can define the size of PE and LE during the physical and logical device creation.
    - The default PE and LE size is 4 MiB.
    - If the size of the PE is increased, the maximum size of the LVM is determined by the kernel limits and your disk space.

The following tables describe the chunk size and volume size limits for static and host configurations:

**Tested configuration**

| Parameter           | Value   |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Chunk size          | 128 KiB |
| Maximum volume size | 32 TiB  |

**Theoretical size limits for static configuration**

| Parameter   | Minimum value                                                                  | Maximum value                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Chunk size  | 64 KiB                                                                         | 1 GiB                                        |
| Volume size | Minimum size of the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) system. | Maximum size of the underlying RHCOS system. |

**Theoretical size limits for a host configuration**

| Parameter           | Value                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chunk size          | This value is based on the configuration in the `lvm.conf` file. By default, the configuration sets the value to `128` KiB. |
| Maximum volume size | Equal to the maximum volume size of the underlying RHCOS system.                                                            |
| Minimum volume size | Equal to the minimum volume size of the underlying RHCOS system.                                                            |

### About adding devices to a volume group { #about-adding-devices-to-a-vg_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To add devices to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group, use the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` Custom Resource (CR) to specify the paths to the devices.

You can specify the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field, the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both the `deviceSelector.paths` field and the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, LVM Storage adds the supported unused devices to the volume group (VG).

!!! warning

    It is recommended to avoid referencing disks using symbolic naming, such as `/dev/sdX`, as these names may change across reboots within RHCOS. Instead, you must use stable naming schemes, such as `/dev/disk/by-path/` or `/dev/disk/by-id/`, to ensure consistent disk identification.

    With this change, you might need to adjust existing automation workflows in the cases where monitoring collects information about the install device for each node.

    For more information, see the "RHEL documentation".

You can add the path to the Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) arrays in the `deviceSelector` field to integrate the RAID arrays with LVM Storage. You can create the RAID array by using the `mdadm` utility. LVM Storage does not support creating a software RAID.

!!! note

    You can create a RAID array only during an OpenShift Container Platform installation. For information on creating a RAID array, see:

    - "Configuring a RAID-enabled data volume"
    - "Creating a software RAID on an installed system"
    - "Replacing a failed disk in RAID"
    - "Repairing RAID disks"

You can also add encrypted devices to the volume group. You can enable disk encryption on the cluster nodes during an OpenShift Container Platform installation. After encrypting a device, you can specify the path to the LUKS encrypted device in the `deviceSelector` field. For information on disk encryption, see "About disk encryption" and "Configuring disk encryption and mirroring".

The devices that you want to add to the VG must be supported by LVM Storage. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage".

LVM Storage adds the devices to the VG only if the following conditions are met:

- The device path exists.
- The device is supported by LVM Storage.

!!! warning

    After a device is added to the VG, you cannot remove the device.

LVM Storage supports dynamic device discovery. If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, LVM Storage automatically adds the new devices to the VG when the devices are available.

!!! warning

    It is not recommended to add the devices to the VG through dynamic device discovery due to the following reasons:

    - When you add a new device that you do not intend to add to the VG, LVM Storage automatically adds this device to the VG through dynamic device discovery.
    - If LVM Storage adds a device to the VG through dynamic device discovery, LVM Storage does not restrict you from removing the device from the node. Removing or updating the devices that are already added to the VG can disrupt the VG. This can also lead to data loss and necessitate manual node remediation.

### About removing devices and device classes from a volume group { #about-removing-devices-deviceclasses-from-a-vg_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can remove devices and device classes from a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) volume group to decommission storage hardware or reorganize your storage configuration by updating the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR.

#### Removing the device paths in the deviceSelector.paths field { #removing-device-paths-in-deviceselectorpaths-field_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can remove the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.

!!! warning

    Ensure that the following criteria are met before removing device paths:

    - The device that you want to remove is empty. You can use the `pvdisplay` command to see attributes of physical volumes (PVs) used in LVM.
    - At least one additional device is specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field.

#### Removing the deviceClass from the LVMCluster { #removing-device-classes-from-lvmcluster_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can also remove the `deviceClass` object from the `LVMCluster` resource. For device class deletion, there is no need to delete `deviceSelector.paths` object.

!!! warning

    Ensure that the following criteria are met before removing a device class:

    - The `deviceClasses.default` field is set to `false`.
    - The disks specified in the `deviceSelector.paths` field are empty.
    - At least one additional device class is specified in the `storage` field.

### Devices not supported by LVM Storage { #lvms-unsupported-devices_logical-volume-manager-storage }

When adding device paths to the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), ensure devices are supported by LVM Storage. LVM Storage excludes unsupported devices to avoid complexity in managing logical volumes.

If you do not specify any device path in the `deviceSelector` field, LVM Storage adds only the unused devices that it supports.

!!! note

    To get information about the devices, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ lsblk --paths --json -o \
    NAME,ROTA,TYPE,SIZE,MODEL,VENDOR,RO,STATE,KNAME,SERIAL,PARTLABEL,FSTYPE
    ```

LVM Storage does not support the following devices:

Read-only devices
:   Devices with the `ro` parameter set to `true`.

Suspended devices
:   Devices with the `state` parameter set to `suspended`.

ROM devices
:   Devices with the `type` parameter set to `rom`.

LVM partition devices
:   Devices with the `type` parameter set to `lvm`.

Devices with invalid partition labels
:   Devices with the `partlabel` parameter set to `bios`, `boot`, or `reserved`.

Devices with an invalid filesystem
:   Devices with the `fstype` parameter set to any value other than `null` or `LVM2_member`.

    !!! warning

        LVM Storage supports devices with `fstype` parameter set to `LVM2_member` only if the devices do not contain children devices.

Devices that are part of another volume group
:   To get the information about the volume groups of the device, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ pvs <device-name>
    ```

    Where `<device-name>` is the device name.

Devices with bind mounts
:   To get the mount points of a device, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ cat /proc/1/mountinfo | grep <device-name>
    ```

    Where `<device-name>` is the device name.

Devices that contain children devices

```
:::note
```

&#58;   It is recommended to wipe the device before using it in LVM Storage to prevent unexpected behavior.

```

## Ways to create an LVMCluster custom resource { #about-creating-lvmcluster-cr_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) to configure LVM Storage deployment and provision storage for your workloads by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), OpenShift Container Platform web console, or Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

You must install LVM Storage by using RHACM if you want to create an `LVMCluster` CR by using RHACM.

!!! warning

    You must create the `LVMCluster` CR in the same namespace where you installed the LVM Storage Operator, which is `openshift-storage` by default.

After creating the `LVMCluster` CR, LVM Storage creates the following system-managed CRs:

- A `storageClass` and `volumeSnapshotClass` for each device class.

    !!! note

        LVM Storage configures the name of the storage class and volume snapshot class in the format `lvms-<device_class_name>`, where, `<device_class_name>` is the value of the `deviceClasses.name` field in the `LVMCluster` CR. For example, if the `deviceClasses.name` field is set to vg1, the name of the storage class and volume snapshot class is `lvms-vg1`.

- `LVMVolumeGroup`: This CR is a specific type of persistent volume (PV) that is backed by an LVM volume group. It tracks the individual volume groups across multiple nodes.

- `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus`: This CR tracks the status of the volume groups on a node.

### Reusing a volume group from the previous LVM Storage installation { #lvms-reusing-vg-from-prev-installation_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can reuse an existing volume group (VG) from a previous LVM Storage installation to preserve your existing storage configuration and avoid recreating VGs when reinstalling or upgrading LVM Storage.

You can only reuse a VG, but not the logical volume associated with the VG.

!!! warning

    You can perform this procedure only while creating an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

**Prerequisites**

- The VG that you want to reuse must not be corrupted.
- The VG that you want to reuse must have the `lvms` tag. For more information on adding tags to LVM objects, see "Grouping LVM objects with tags".

**Procedure**

1. Open the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

2. Configure the `LVMCluster` CR parameters as described in the following example:

    ```yaml title="Example LVMCluster CR YAML file"
    apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
    kind: LVMCluster
    metadata:
      name: my-lvmcluster
    spec:
    # ...
      storage:
        deviceClasses:
        - name: vg1
          fstype: ext4
          default: true
          deviceSelector:
    # ...
            forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData: false
          thinPoolConfig:
    # ...
          nodeSelector:
    # ...
    ```

    - `spec.storage.deviceClasses.name`: Specifies the name of a VG from the previous LVM Storage installation.
    - `spec.storage.deviceClasses.fstype`: Set this field to `ext4` or `xfs`. By default, this field is set to `xfs`.
    - `spec.storage.deviceClasses.name.deviceSelector`: You can add new devices to the VG that you want to reuse by specifying the new device paths in the `deviceSelector` field. If you do not want to add new devices to the VG, ensure that the `deviceSelector` configuration in the current LVM Storage installation is same as that of the previous LVM Storage installation.
    - `spec...forceWipeDevicesAndDestroyAllData`: If this field is set to `true`, LVM Storage wipes all the data on the devices that are added to the VG.
    - `spec....thinPoolConfig`: To retain the `thinPoolConfig` configuration of the VG that you want to reuse, ensure that the `thinPoolConfig` configuration in the current LVM Storage installation is same as that of the previous LVM Storage installation. Otherwise, you can configure the `thinPoolConfig` field as required.
    - `spec...nodeSelector`: Configure the requirements to choose the nodes on which you want to create the LVM volume group. If this field is empty, all nodes without no-schedule taints are considered.

3. Save the `LVMCluster` CR YAML file.

**Verification**

To view the devices that are part a volume group, run the following command:

```terminal
$ pvs -S vgname=<vg_name>
```

### Creating an LVMCluster CR by using the CLI { #lvms-creating-lvms-cluster-using-cli_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) on a worker node by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to configure storage deployment and provision local storage for your workloads.

!!! warning

    You can only create a single instance of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) on an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
- You have installed LVM Storage.
- You have installed a worker node in the cluster.
- You read "About the LVMCluster custom resource".

**Procedure**

1. Create an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) YAML file:

    ```yaml title="Example LVMCluster CR YAML file"
    apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
    kind: LVMCluster
    metadata:
      name: my-lvmcluster
      namespace: openshift-lvm-storage
    spec:
    # ...
      storage:
        deviceClasses:
    # ...
          nodeSelector:
    # ...
          deviceSelector: 
    # ...
          thinPoolConfig:
    # ...
    ```

    - `spec.storage.deviceClasses`: Specifies the configuration to assign the local storage devices to the LVM volume groups.
    - `spec...nodeSelector`: Specifies the configuration to choose the nodes on which you want to create the LVM volume group. If this field is empty, all nodes without no-schedule taints are considered.
    - `spec...deviceSelector`: Specifies the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group, and force wipe the devices that are added to the LVM volume group.
    - `spec...thinPoolConfig`: Specifies the configuration to create a thin pool in the LVM volume group. If you exclude this field, logical volumes are thick provisioned.

2. Create the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    lvmcluster/lvmcluster created
    ```

**Verification**

1. Check that the `LVMCluster` CR is in the `Ready` state by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get lvmclusters.lvm.topolvm.io -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status}' -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```json title="Example output"
    {"deviceClassStatuses":
    [ 
      {
        "name": "vg1", 
        "nodeStatus": [ 
            {
                "devices": [ 
                    "/dev/nvme0n1",
                    "/dev/nvme1n1",
                    "/dev/nvme2n1"
                ],
                "node": "kube-node", 
                "status": "Ready"
            }
        ]
      }
    ]
    "state":"Ready"}
    ```

    - `deviceClassStatuses`: Specifies the status of the device class.

    - `nodeStatus`: Specifies the status of the LVM volume group on each node.

    - `devices`: Specifies the list of devices used to create the LVM volume group.

    - `node`: Specifies the node on which the device class is created.

    - `status`: Specifies the status of the LVM volume group on the node.

    - `state`: Specifies the status of the `LVMCluster` CR.

        !!! note

            If the `LVMCluster` CR is in the `Failed` state, you can view the reason for failure in the `status` field. + Example of `status` field with the reason for failure:

            ```yaml
            status:
              deviceClassStatuses:
                - name: vg1
                  nodeStatus:
                    - node: my-node-1.example.com 
                      reason: no available devices found for volume group
                      status: Failed
              state: Failed
            ```

2. To view the storage classes created by LVM Storage for each device class, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get storageclass
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME          PROVISIONER          RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
    lvms-vg1      topolvm.io           Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   true                   31m
    ```

3. To view the volume snapshot classes created by LVM Storage for each device class, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get volumesnapshotclass
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME          DRIVER               DELETIONPOLICY   AGE

### Deleting an LVMCluster { #deleting-an-lvm-cluster_logical-volume-manager-storage }

When you delete an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), the Operator enforces deletion gates to prevent data loss. The gates that apply depend on the reclaim policy that is configured for the storage class.

**Prerequisites**

- You have administrative access to the cluster.
- You have identified the reclaim policy in use: `Delete` or `Retain`.

**Procedure**

1. Delete all Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) that reference LVM `StorageClass` resources.

    If PVCs that reference LVM StorageClasses still exist, the Operator blocks `LVMCluster` deletion and generates a `DeletionPending` event:

    ```terminal
    found PVCs provisioned by LVMS, waiting 10s for their deletion
    ```

2. Back up any data before deleting PVCs.

    1. List the PVCs that use the LVM StorageClass by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc get pvc -A -o custom-columns='NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,SC:.spec.storageClassName' | grep lvms-vg1
        ```

    2. Delete the PVCs by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc delete pvc <pvc_name> -n <namespace>
        ```

        With the `Delete` reclaim policy, deleting the PVCs automatically removes the persistent volumes (PVs) and on-disk logical volumes. After all PVCs are removed, `LVMCluster` deletion completes automatically. No further action is required.

3. If you use the `Retain` reclaim policy, delete the retained PVs.

    After you delete PVCs, if the reclaim policy is `Retain`, the Operator blocks `LVMCluster` deletion and generates a `DeletionPending` event:

    ```terminal
    found PVs with Retain policy from LVMS, waiting 10s for manual cleanup
    ```

    1. List the retained PVs by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc get pv -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,SC:.spec.storageClassName' | grep lvms-vg1
        ```

    2. Delete the PVs by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc delete pv <pv_name>
        ```

4. If you are using the `Retain` reclaim policy, delete the TopoLVM `LogicalVolume` custom resources.

    After you delete PV objects from Kubernetes, the underlying logical volumes remain on disk because the `Retain` policy preserved them. The VG Manager detects this and generates a `ManualCleanupRequired` event:

    ```terminal
    Warning  ManualCleanupRequired  volume group vg1 has retained logical volumes [pvc-abc123]; manual cleanup required before deletion can proceed
    ```

5. Deleting the `LogicalVolume` custom resources triggers on-disk logical volume cleanup.

    1. List the `LogicalVolume` custom resources by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc get logicalvolumes
        ```

    2. Delete the `LogicalVolume` custom resources for your device class by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc delete logicalvolume <lv_name>
        ```

**Verification**

- Verify that the `LVMCluster` deletion completed by confirming the resource no longer exists by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get lvmcluster -A
    ```

## Provisioning storage by using LVM Storage { #lvms-provisioning-storage-using-lvms_logical-volume-manager-storage }

After you have created the LVM volume groups by using the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR), you can provision storage for your workloads by creating persistent volume claims (PVCs) that dynamically allocate local storage from the volume groups.

The following are the minimum storage sizes that you can request for each file system type:

- `block`: 8 MiB
- `xfs`: 300 MiB
- `ext4`: 32 MiB

To create a PVC, you must create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object.

**Prerequisites**

- You have created an `LVMCluster` CR.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object:

    ```yaml title="Example PersistentVolumeClaim object"
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: lvm-block-1
      namespace: default
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
        limits:
          storage: 20Gi
      storageClassName: lvms-vg1
    ```

    - `metadata.name`: Specifies a name for the PVC.

    - `spec.volumeMode`: To create a file PVC, set this field to `Filesystem`. To create a block PVC, set this field to `Block`.

    - `spec.resources.requests.storage`: Specifies the storage size. If the value is less than the minimum storage size, the requested storage size is rounded to the minimum storage size. The total storage size you can provision is limited by the size of the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) thin pool and the over-provisioning factor.

    - `spec.resources.limits.storage`: (optional) Specifies the storage limit. Set this field to a value that is greater than or equal to the minimum storage size. Otherwise, PVC creation fails with an error.

    - `spec.storageClassName`: The value of the `storageClassName` field must be in the format `lvms-<device_class_name>` where `<device_class_name>` is the value of the `deviceClasses.name` field in the `LVMCluster` CR.

        For example, if the `deviceClasses.name` field is set to `vg1`, you must set the `storageClassName` field to `lvms-vg1`.

        !!! note

            The `volumeBindingMode` field of the storage class is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`.

3. Create the PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    # oc create -f <file_name> -n <application_namespace>
    ```

    !!! note

        The created PVCs remain in `Pending` state until you deploy the pods that use them.

**Verification**

- To verify that the PVC is created, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME          STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE

## StorageClass customization for LVMS device classes { #storageclass-customization-for-lvms-device-classes_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can customize the StorageClass for each device class by specifying reclaim policy, volume binding mode, parameters, and labels in the LVMCluster custom resource (CR).

Before, Logical Volume Manager Storage (LVMS) automatically created a StorageClass for each device class without allowing modification. If you attempted to manually edit a generated StorageClass, the Operator overwrote your changes during the next reconciliation loop.

The `storageClassOptions` field lets you control four properties of the generated StorageClass:

- `reclaimPolicy`
- `volumeBindingMode`
- `additionalParameters`
- `additionalLabels`

If you omit `storageClassOptions`, LVMS creates the StorageClass with the same defaults as in previous versions. Existing `LVMCluster` configurations are fully compatible with earlier versions.

!!! note

    No user action is required after upgrading. The `storageClassOptions` field is optional, and default values match the behavior before this feature was introduced.

### StorageClass options for LVMS device classes { #storageclass-options_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can configure custom StorageClass behaviors for each device class, including reclaim policy, volume binding mode, and custom parameters and labels, by defining the storageClassOptions field in the LVMCluster custom resource.

If you set an empty configuration (storageClassOptions: {}) or omit the field entirely, the Operator uses the following default settings:

### Updating LVM cluster labels { #updating-lvm-cluster-labels_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To organize and categorize your storage resources, you can update, remove, or clear custom StorageClass labels by patching the additionalLabels field in the LVMCluster custom resource.

**Procedure**

1. Patch the `LVMCluster` resource to update `additionalLabels` by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc -n openshift-lvm-storage patch lvmcluster <name> --type=json \
      -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/storage/deviceClasses/0/storageClassOptions/additionalLabels","value":{"environment":"staging"}}]'
    ```

2. To remove a specific label, update `additionalLabels` without the label you want to remove. The Operator removes the label from the `StorageClass` during the next reconciliation.

3. To remove all custom labels, set `additionalLabels` to an empty map `{}`.

    !!! note

        The Operator preserves labels that you add directly to the `StorageClass`, for example with `oc label storageclass lvms-vg1 my-label=value`. The Operator prunes only the labels that you manage through the `additionalLabels` field in the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) when you remove them from the CR.

### Sample LVM cluster configuration with storage class option { #sample-lvm-cluster-configuration-with-storage-class-option_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Use these examples to configure `storageClassOptions` in your `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) to meet your specific storage requirements.

```yaml title="Default StorageClass behavior (no options)"
apiVersion: lvm.topolvm.io/v1alpha1
kind: LVMCluster
metadata:
  name: my-lvmcluster
  namespace: openshift-lvm-storage
spec:
  storage:

      thinPoolConfig:
        name: thin-pool-1
        sizePercent: 90
        overprovisionRatio: 10
```

This produces a `StorageClass` with `reclaimPolicy: Delete` and `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, which is the same as the behavior before this feature.

        reclaimPolicy: Retain
        volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
        additionalLabels:
          tier: archive
```

For a device class named `vg1` with the full configuration, LVMS generates a `StorageClass` named `lvms-vg1` with the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: lvms-vg1
  annotations:
    description: "Provides RWO and RWOP Filesystem & Block volumes"
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  labels:
    environment: production
    team: storage
provisioner: topolvm.io
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  custom-key: custom-value
  topolvm.io/device-class: vg1
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs
```

The `StorageClass` name always follows the convention `lvms-<device_class_name>`.

### Immutable fields of the storage class options { #immutable-fields-of-the-storage-class-options_logical-volume-manager-storage }

After you create the LVMCluster custom resource, you cannot change certain `storageClassOptions` fields, such as `reclaimPolicy`, `volumeBindingMode`, and `additionalParameters`. To change an immutable field, you must delete and recreate the LVMCluster with the new values.

This mirrors the behavior of Kubernetes `StorageClasses`, which do not allow changes to these fields after creation.

If you attempt to modify an immutable field, the API server rejects the request:

```terminal
Invalid value: "object": reclaimPolicy is immutable once set
```

There is no way to patch or update immutable fields in place. To change an immutable field, you must delete the `LVMCluster` and recreate it with the new values.

For example, you cannot change the filesystem type through `additionalParameters`.  The `csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype` parameter is managed by LVMS and is rejected at admission if set through `additionalParameters`. To use `ext4` instead of the default `xfs`, use the `fstype` field on the device class:

```yaml
deviceClasses:
- name: vg1
  fstype: ext4
```

However, the `fstype` field is also immutable after creation.

!!! note

    The deletion gates require all PVCs and, for the `Retain` policy, all PVs to be removed before the `LVMCluster` can be deleted. After you recreate the `LVMCluster` with the new values, new PVCs use the updated StorageClass configuration.

### Behaviors not controlled by StorageClass options { #behaviors-not-controlled-by-storage-class-options_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Review these behaviors before you delete an LVMCluster. Although these behaviors relate to `storageClassOptions`, the `storageClassOptions` field does not control them.

Volume expansion behavior
:   Logical Volume Manager Storage (LVMS) always enables volume expansion by setting `allowVolumeExpansion: true` on generated StorageClasses. You cannot control this setting by using the `storageClassOptions` field. All LVMS volumes support online expansion.

VolumeSnapshotClass management
:   The `storageClassOptions` field only affects StorageClasses. When you configure thin provisioning, LVMS generates a `VolumeSnapshotClass` for each device class. This generated class always uses a fixed value `deletionPolicy: Delete`, regardless of the reclaimPolicy that you set in `storageClassOptions`.

    Additionally, LVMS does not apply the `additionalParameters` and `additionalLabels` fields to `VolumeSnapshotClasses`. If you need to retain snapshot data, you must manage it separately from the StorageClass reclaim policy.

Default StorageClass annotation behavior
:   The default field on a device class controls the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation on the generated StorageClass.

    Setting `default: true` does not guarantee that the LVMS StorageClass becomes the cluster default. If another default StorageClass already exists on the cluster, for example, gp3-csi on AWS-based OpenShift Container Platform clusters, LVMS sets the annotation to `false` to prevent many cluster-wide defaults. Because the Operator actively manages this annotation, it reverts any manual, out-of-band changes during the next reconciliation loop.

## Ways to scale up the storage of clusters { #lvms-about-scaling-storage-of-cluster_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Scale up worker node storage capacity when running out of space, adding new applications, or expanding cluster capacity by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to add new devices or worker nodes.

OpenShift Container Platform supports additional worker nodes for clusters on bare metal user-provisioned infrastructure.

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage detects and uses additional worker nodes when the nodes become active.

To add a new device to the existing worker nodes on a cluster, you must add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

!!! warning

    You can add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR only while creating the `LVMCluster` CR. If you have not added the `deviceSelector` field while creating the `LVMCluster` CR, you must delete the `LVMCluster` CR and create a new `LVMCluster` CR containing the `deviceSelector` field.

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, LVM Storage automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

!!! note

    LVM Storage adds only the supported devices. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage".

### Scaling up the storage of clusters by using the CLI { #lvms-scaling-storage-of-clusters-using-cli_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Scale up worker node storage capacity when running out of space, adding new applications, or expanding cluster capacity by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to add new devices or worker nodes.

**Prerequisites**

- You have additional unused devices on each cluster to be used by Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage.
- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have created an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

**Procedure**

1. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc edit <lvmcluster_file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

2. Add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field.

    ```

    - `spec...deviceSelector`: Contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group. You can specify the device paths in the `paths` field, the `optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both `paths` and `optionalPaths`, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group. LVM Storage adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:

        - The device path exists.
        - The device is supported by LVM Storage. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage".

    - `spec...deviceSelector.paths`: Specifies the device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by LVM Storage, the `LVMCluster` CR moves to the `Failed` state.

    - `spec...deviceSelector.optionalPaths`: Specifies the optional device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by LVM Storage, LVM Storage ignores the device without causing an error.

        !!! warning

            After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.

3. Save the `LVMCluster` CR.

### Scaling up the storage of clusters by using RHACM { #lvms-scaling-storage-of-clusters-using-rhacm_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Scale up worker node storage capacity when running out of space, adding new applications, or expanding cluster capacity by using RHACM to add new devices or worker nodes.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the RHACM cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` privileges.
- You have created an `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) by using RHACM.
- You have additional unused devices on each cluster to be used by Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the RHACM CLI using your OpenShift Container Platform credentials.

2. Edit the `LVMCluster` CR that you created using RHACM by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc edit -f <file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    Replace `<file_name>` with the name of the `LVMCluster` CR.

3. In the `LVMCluster` CR, add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field.

If you do not specify the device paths in both `paths` and `optionalPaths`, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage adds the supported unused devices to the LVM volume group. LVM Storage adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the following conditions are met:

        - The device path exists.
        - The device is supported by LVM Storage. For information about unsupported devices, see "Devices not supported by LVM Storage".

    - `paths`: Specifies the device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by LVM Storage, the `LVMCluster` CR moves to the `Failed` state.

    - `optionalPaths`: Specifies the optional device paths. If the device path specified in this field does not exist, or the device is not supported by LVM Storage, LVM Storage ignores the device without causing an error.

        !!! warning

            After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.

4. Save the `LVMCluster` CR.

## Expanding a persistent volume claim { #lvms-scaling-expand-pvc_logical-volume-manager-storage }

After scaling up cluster storage, you can expand existing persistent volume claims (PVCs) to increase their storage capacity by updating the `storage` field in the PVC.

**Prerequisites**

- Dynamic provisioning is used.
- The `StorageClass` object associated with the PVC has the `allowVolumeExpansion` field set to `true`.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Update the value of the `spec.resources.requests.storage` field to a value that is greater than the current value by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc patch pvc <pvc_name> -n <application_namespace> \
      --type=merge -p \ '{ "spec": { "resources": { "requests": { "storage": "<desired_size>" }}}}'
    ```

    - Replace `<pvc_name>` with the name of the PVC that you want to expand.
    - Replace `<desired_size>` with the new size to expand the PVC.

**Verification**

- To verify that resizing is completed, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc <pvc_name> -n <application_namespace> -o=jsonpath={.status.capacity.storage}
    ```

    LVM Storage adds the `Resizing` condition to the PVC during expansion. It deletes the `Resizing` condition after the PVC expansion.

## Deleting a persistent volume claim { #lvms-deleting-pvc_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can delete a persistent volume claim (PVC) when it is no longer needed to free up storage resources or when decommissioning an application by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Delete the PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete pvc <pvc_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

**Verification**

- To verify that the PVC is deleted, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
    ```

    The deleted PVC must not be present in the output of this command.

## About volume snapshots { #lvms-about-volume-snapshots_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can create volume snapshots of persistent volume claims (PVCs) provisioned by LVM Storage to back up application data or revert to a previous state, providing data protection and recovery capabilities.

You can perform the following actions using the volume snapshots:

- Back up your application data.

    !!! warning

        Volume snapshots are located on the same devices as the original data. To use the volume snapshots as backups, you must move the snapshots to a secure location. You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) backup and restore solutions. For information about OADP, see "OADP features".

- Revert to a state at which the volume snapshot was taken.

!!! note

    You can also create volume snapshots of the volume clones.

### Limitations for creating volume snapshots in multi-node topology { #lvms-about-volume-snapshots-limits_logical-volume-manager-storage }

LVM Storage has the following limitations for creating volume snapshots in multi-node topology:

- Creating volume snapshots is based on the LVM thin pool capabilities.
- After creating a volume snapshot, the node must have additional storage space for further updating the original data source.
- You can create volume snapshots only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
- Pods relying on the PVC that uses the snapshot data can be scheduled only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.

**Additional resources**

- [OADP features](../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/oadp-features-plugins.md#oadp-features_oadp-features-plugins)

### Creating volume snapshots { #lvms-creating-volume-snapshots_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Create volume snapshots to capture point-in-time copies of persistent volume claims (PVCs) for data backup or recovery purposes by creating a `VolumeSnapshot` object, based on the available thin pool capacity and over-provisioning limits.

To create a volume snapshot, you must create a `VolumeSnapshotClass` object.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You ensured that the persistent volume claim (PVC) is in `Bound` state. This is required for a consistent snapshot.
- You stopped all the I/O to the PVC.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Create a `VolumeSnapshot` object:

    ```yaml title="Example VolumeSnapshot object"
    apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    metadata:
      name: lvm-block-1-snap
    spec:
      source:
        persistentVolumeClaimName: lvm-block-1
      volumeSnapshotClassName: lvms-vg1
    ```

    - `metadata.name`: Specifies a name for the volume snapshot.

    - `spec.source.persistentVolumeClaimName`: Specifies the name of the source PVC. LVM Storage creates a snapshot of this PVC.

    - `spec.volumeSnapshotClassName`: Specifies the name of a volume snapshot class.

        !!! note

            To get the list of available volume snapshot classes, run the following command:

            ```terminal
            $ oc get volumesnapshotclass
            ```

3. Create the volume snapshot in the namespace where you created the source PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    LVM Storage creates a read-only copy of the PVC as a volume snapshot.

**Verification**

- To verify that the volume snapshot is created, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get volumesnapshot -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME               READYTOUSE   SOURCEPVC     SOURCESNAPSHOTCONTENT   RESTORESIZE   SNAPSHOTCLASS   SNAPSHOTCONTENT                                    CREATIONTIME   AGE
    lvm-block-1-snap   true         lvms-test-1                           1Gi           lvms-vg1        snapcontent-af409f97-55fc-40cf-975f-71e44fa2ca91   19s            19s
    ```

    The value of the `READYTOUSE` field for the volume snapshot that you created must be `true`.

### Restoring volume snapshots { #lvms-restoring-volume-snapshots_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Restore volume snapshots to recover data from a previous point in time by creating a persistent volume claim (PVC) that references the snapshot, producing an independent copy separate from the original snapshot and source PVC.

To restore a volume snapshot, you must create a persistent volume claim (PVC) with the `dataSource.name` field set to the name of the volume snapshot.

The restored PVC is independent of the volume snapshot and the source PVC.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You have created a volume snapshot.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object with the configuration to restore the volume snapshot:

    ```yaml title="Example PersistentVolumeClaim object to restore a volume snapshot"
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: lvm-block-1-restore
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      volumeMode: Block
      Resources:
        Requests:
          storage: 2Gi
      storageClassName: lvms-vg1
      dataSource:
        name: lvm-block-1-snap
        kind: VolumeSnapshot
        apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
    ```

    - `spec.Resources.Requests.storage`: Specifies the storage size of the restored PVC. The storage size of the requested PVC must be greater than or equal to the storage size of the volume snapshot that you want to restore. If a larger PVC is required, you can also resize the PVC after restoring the volume snapshot.
    - `spec.storageClassName`: Set this field to the value of the `storageClassName` field in the source PVC of the volume snapshot that you want to restore.
    - `spec.dataSource.name`: Set this field to the name of the volume snapshot that you want to restore.

3. Create the PVC in the namespace where you created the volume snapshot by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

**Verification**

- To verify that the volume snapshot is restored, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    lvm-block-1-restore   Bound    pvc-e90169a8-fd71-4eea-93b8-817155f60e47   1Gi        RWO            lvms-vg1       5s
    ```

### Deleting volume snapshots { #lvms-deleting-volume-snapshots_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Delete volume snapshots when they are no longer needed to free up storage resources and prevent orphaned snapshots, since LVM Storage does not automatically delete snapshots when you delete the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

!!! warning

    When you delete a persistent volume claim (PVC), LVM Storage deletes only the PVC, but not the snapshots of the PVC.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You have ensured that the volume snapshot that you want to delete is not in use.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Delete the volume snapshot by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete volumesnapshot <volume_snapshot_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

**Verification**

- To verify that the volume snapshot is deleted, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get volumesnapshot -n <namespace>
    ```

    The deleted volume snapshot must not be present in the output of this command.

## About volume clones { #lvms-about-volume-clones_logical-volume-manager-storage }

A volume clone is a duplicate of an existing persistent volume claim (PVC) that creates a point-in-time copy of data more efficiently than snapshots, useful for testing, development, or creating independent copies of application data.

### Limitations for creating volume clones in multi-node topology { #lvms-about-volume-clones-limits_logical-volume-manager-storage }

LVM Storage has the following limitations for creating volume clones in multi-node topology:

- Creating volume clones is based on the LVM thin pool capabilities.
- The node must have additional storage after creating a volume clone for further updating the original data source.
- You can create volume clones only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.
- Pods relying on the PVC that uses the clone data can be scheduled only on the node where you have deployed the original data source.

### Creating volume clones { #lvms-creating-volume-clones_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Create volume clones to duplicate persistent volume claim (PVC) data for testing, development, or creating independent writable copies by creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object that references the source PVC.

You must create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object in the namespace where you created the source PVC.

!!! warning

    The cloned PVC has write access.

**Prerequisites**

- You ensured that the source PVC is in `Bound` state. This is required for a consistent clone.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object:

    ```yaml title="Example PersistentVolumeClaim object to create a volume clone"
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: lvm-pvc-clone
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      storageClassName: lvms-vg1
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      dataSource:
        kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
        name: lvm-pvc
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
    ```

    - `spec.storageClassName`: Set this field to the value of the `storageClassName` field in the source PVC.
    - `spec.volumeMode`: Set this field to the `volumeMode` field in the source PVC.
    - `spec.dataSource.name`: Specifies the name of the source PVC.
    - `spec.resources.requests.storage`: Specifies the storage size for the cloned PVC. The storage size of the cloned PVC must be greater than or equal to the storage size of the source PVC.

3. Create the PVC in the namespace where you created the source PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc create -f <file_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

**Verification**

- To verify that the volume clone is created, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    lvm-block-1-clone   Bound    pvc-e90169a8-fd71-4eea-93b8-817155f60e47   1Gi        RWO            lvms-vg1       5s
    ```

### Deleting volume clones { #lvms-deleting-cloned-volumes_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Delete volume clones when they are no longer needed to free up storage resources, since LVM Storage does not automatically delete clones when you delete the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

!!! warning

    When you delete a persistent volume claim (PVC), LVM Storage deletes only the source persistent volume claim (PVC) but not the clones of the PVC.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to OpenShift Container Platform as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Delete the cloned PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal

## Monitoring LVM Storage { #lvms-monitoring_logical-volume-manager-storage }

You can monitor LVM Storage by enabling cluster monitoring with a namespace label, then viewing metrics to track storage usage and receiving alerts when thin pool and volume group capacity reaches critical thresholds to prevent data loss.

To enable cluster monitoring, you must add a label in the namespace where you have installed LVM Storage.

!!! warning

    For information about enabling cluster monitoring in RHACM, see "Observability" and "Adding custom metrics".

**Procedure**

- To enable cluster monitoring, add the following label in the namespace where you have installed LVM Storage:

```text
openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true
```

## Uninstalling LVM Storage installed using RHACM { #lvms-uninstalling-lvms-rhacm_logical-volume-manager-storage }

To uninstall LVM Storage that you installed by using RHACM when it is no longer needed or before switching to a different storage solution, delete the RHACM `Policy` custom resource (CR) that you created for installation after removing all provisioned storage resources.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the RHACM cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You have deleted the persistent volume claims (PVCs), volume snapshots, and volume clones provisioned by LVM Storage. You have also deleted the applications that are using these resources.
- You have deleted the `LVMCluster` CR that you created using RHACM.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

2. Delete the RHACM `Policy` CR that you created for installing and configuring LVM Storage by using the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete -f <policy> -n <namespace>
    ```

    Replace `<policy>` with the name of the `Policy` CR YAML file.

3. Create a `Policy` CR YAML file with the configuration to uninstall LVM Storage:

    ```

## Downloading log files and diagnostic information using must-gather { #lvms-dowloading-log-files-and-diagnostics_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Use the must-gather tool to collect log files and diagnostic information when LVM Storage cannot automatically resolve a problem. You or Red Hat Support can then review the collected data to troubleshoot the issue.

**Procedure**

- Run the `must-gather` command from the client connected to the LVM Storage cluster:

    ```terminal
    $ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/lvms4/lvms-must-gather-rhel9:v4.22 --dest-dir=<directory_name>
    ```

## Troubleshooting persistent storage { #lvms-troubleshooting-persistent-storage_logical-volume-manager-storage }

If persistent storage issues occur with Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage, such as persistent volume claims (PVCs) stuck in a pending state, missing components, or node and disk failures, you can diagnose and resolve the problem by reviewing logs and recovering affected resources.

### Investigating a PVC stuck in the Pending state { #investigating-a-pvc-stuck-in-the-pending-state_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Investigate persistent volume claims (PVCs) stuck in a `Pending` state to determine whether the cause is insufficient resources, network problems, mismatched storage classes, or unavailable persistent volumes (PVs).

A persistent volume claim (PVC) can get stuck in the `Pending` state for the following reasons:

- Insufficient computing resources.
- Network problems.
- Mismatched storage class or node selector.
- No available persistent volumes (PVs).
- The node with the PV is in the `Not Ready` state.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Retrieve the list of PVCs by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pvc
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME        STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    lvms-test   Pending                                      lvms-vg1       11s
    ```

2. Inspect the events associated with a PVC stuck in the `Pending` state by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
    ```

    Replace `<pvc_name>` with the name of the PVC. For example, `lvms-vg1`.

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Type     Reason              Age               From                         Message
    ----     ------              ----              ----                         -------
    Warning  ProvisioningFailed  4s (x2 over 17s)  persistentvolume-controller  storageclass.storage.k8s.io "lvms-vg1" not found
    ```

### Recovering from a missing storage class { #recovering-from-missing-lvms-or-operator-components_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Resolve the "storage class not found" error by verifying that the LVMCluster custom resource (CR) exists and all Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage pods are running, then reviewing logs to identify configuration issues.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Verify that the `LVMCluster` CR is present by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get lvmcluster -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME            AGE
    my-lvmcluster   65m
    ```

2. If the `LVMCluster` CR is not present, create an `LVMCluster` CR. For more information, see "Ways to create an LVMCluster custom resource".

3. In the namespace where the operator is installed, check that all the LVM Storage pods are in the `Running` state by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pods -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
    lvms-operator-7b9fb858cb-6nsml        3/3     Running   0             70m
    topolvm-controller-5dd9cf78b5-7wwr2   5/5     Running   0             66m
    topolvm-node-dr26h                    4/4     Running   0             66m
    vg-manager-r6zdv                      1/1     Running   0             66m
    ```

    The output of this command must contain a running instance of the following pods:

    - `lvms-operator`

    - `vg-manager`

        If the `vg-manager` pod is stuck while loading a configuration file, it is due to a failure to locate an available disk for LVM Storage to use. To retrieve the necessary information to troubleshoot this issue, review the logs of the `vg-manager` pod by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=vg-manager -n <namespace>
        ```

### Recovering from node failure { #recovering-from-node-failure_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Identify failed nodes causing persistent volume claims (PVCs) to remain in pending state by examining the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod, which indicates potential underlying node problems requiring investigation.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

- Examine the restart count of the `topolvm-node` pod instances by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get pods -n <namespace>
    ```

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE

    vg-manager-r6zdv                      1/1     Running   0             66m
    vg-manager-990ut                      1/1     Running   0             66m
    vg-manager-an118                      1/1     Running   0             66m
    ```

**Next steps**

If the PVC is stuck in the `Pending` state even after you have resolved any issues with the node, you must perform a forced clean-up. For more information, see "Performing a forced clean-up".

### Recovering from disk failure { #recovering-from-disk-failure_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Diagnose and resolve disk and volume provisioning failures by inspecting persistent volume claim (PVC) events to identify specific error messages, then connecting to the affected host to fix the underlying disk issue.

Disk and volume provisioning issues result with a generic error message such as `Failed to provision volume with storage class <storage_class_name>`. The generic error message is followed by a specific volume failure error message.

The following table describes the volume failure error messages:

**Volume failure error messages**

| Error message                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                       |

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.

**Procedure**

1. Inspect the events associated with a PVC by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc describe pvc <pvc_name>
    ```

    Replace `<pvc_name>` with the name of the PVC.

2. Establish a direct connection to the host where the problem is occurring.

3. Resolve the disk issue.

**Next steps**

If the volume failure messages persist or recur even after you have resolved the issue with the disk, you must perform a forced clean-up. For more information, see "Performing a forced clean-up".

**Additional resources**

- [Performing a forced clean-up](persistent-storage-using-lvms.md#performing-a-forced-cleanup_logical-volume-manager-storage)

### Performing a forced clean-up { #performing-a-forced-cleanup_logical-volume-manager-storage }

Perform a forced clean-up by removing all Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Storage custom resources (CRs) when disk or node-related problems continue after standard troubleshooting, to restore proper storage functioning.

If the disk or node-related problems persist even after you have completed the troubleshooting procedures, you must perform a forced clean-up. A forced clean-up is used to address persistent issues and ensure the proper functioning of LVM Storage.

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You have logged in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) as a user with `cluster-admin` permissions.
- You have deleted all the persistent volume claims (PVCs) that were created by using LVM Storage.
- You have stopped the pods that are using the PVCs that were created by using LVM Storage.

**Procedure**

1. Switch to the namespace where you have installed the LVM Storage Operator by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc project <namespace>
    ```

2. Check if the `LogicalVolume` custom resources are present by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get logicalvolume
    ```

    1. If the `LogicalVolume` CRs are present, delete them by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc delete logicalvolume <name>
        ```

        Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LogicalVolume` CR.

    2. After deleting the `LogicalVolume` CRs, remove their finalizers by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc patch logicalvolume <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
        ```

        Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LogicalVolume` CR.

3. Check if the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs are present by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get lvmvolumegroup
    ```

    1. If the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs are present, delete them by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc delete lvmvolumegroup <name>
        ```

        Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMVolumeGroup` CR.

    2. After deleting the `LVMVolumeGroup` CRs, remove their finalizers by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc patch lvmvolumegroup <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
        ```

        Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMVolumeGroup` CR.

4. Delete any `LVMVolumeGroupNodeStatus` CRs by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete lvmvolumegroupnodestatus --all
    ```

5. Delete the `LVMCluster` CR by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc delete lvmcluster --all
    ```

    1. After deleting the `LVMCluster` CR, remove its finalizer by running the following command:

        ```terminal
        $ oc patch lvmcluster <name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
        ```

        Replace `<name>` with the name of the `LVMCluster` CR.
