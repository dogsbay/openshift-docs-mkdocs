# Configuring the OpenShift CLI { #cli-configuring-cli }

You can customize your command-line environment after installing the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

## Enabling tab completion { #cli-enabling-tab-completion }

You can enable tab completion for the Bash or Zsh shells.

### Enabling tab completion for Bash { #cli-enabling-tab-completion_cli-configuring-cli }

After you install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), you can enable tab completion to automatically complete `oc` commands or suggest options when you press Tab. The following procedure enables tab completion for the Bash shell.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.
- You must have the package `bash-completion` installed.

**Procedure**

1. Save the Bash completion code to a file:

    ```terminal
    $ oc completion bash > oc_bash_completion
    ```

2. Copy the file to `/etc/bash_completion.d/`:

    ```terminal
    $ sudo cp oc_bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d/
    ```

    You can also save the file to a local directory and source it from your `.bashrc` file instead. Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.

### Enabling tab completion for Zsh { #cli-enabling-tab-completion-zsh_cli-configuring-cli }

After you install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), you can enable tab completion to automatically complete `oc` commands or suggest options when you press Tab. The following procedure enables tab completion for the Zsh shell.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

**Procedure**

- To add tab completion for `oc` to your `.zshrc` file, run the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ cat >>~/.zshrc<<EOF
    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
    if [ $commands[oc] ]; then
      source <(oc completion zsh)
      compdef _oc oc
    fi
    EOF
    ```

    Tab completion is enabled when you open a new terminal.

## Accessing kubeconfig by using the oc CLI { #cli-accessing-kubeconfig-using-cli_cli-configuring-cli }

You can use the `oc` CLI to log in to your OpenShift cluster and retrieve a kubeconfig file for accessing the cluster from the command line.

!!! warning

    If you plan to reuse the exported `kubeconfig` file across sessions or machines, store it securely and avoid committing it to source control.

**Prerequisites**

- You have access to the OpenShift Container Platform web console or API server endpoint.

**Procedure**

1. Log in to your OpenShift cluster by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc login <api_server_url> -u <username> -p <password>
    ```

    where:

    `<api_server_url>`
    :   Specifies the full API server URL; for example, `https://api.my-cluster.example.com:6443`.

    `<username>`
    :   Specifies a valid username; for example, `kubeadmin`.

    `<password>`
    :   Specifies the password for the specified user; for example, the `kubeadmin` password generated during cluster installation.

2. Save the cluster configuration to a local file by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc config view --raw > kubeconfig
    ```

3. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to point to the exported file by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ export KUBECONFIG=./kubeconfig
    ```

4. Use `oc` to interact with your OpenShift cluster by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc get nodes
    ```
