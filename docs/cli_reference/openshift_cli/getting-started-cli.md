## Logging in to the OpenShift CLI { #cli-logging-in_cli-developer-commands }

You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to access and manage your cluster.

!!! note

    To access a cluster that is accessible only over an HTTP proxy server, you can set the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` variables. These environment variables are respected by the `oc` CLI so that all communication with the cluster goes through the HTTP proxy.

    Authentication headers are sent only when using HTTPS transport.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have access to a OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

**Procedure**

1. Enter the `oc login` command and pass in a user name:

    ```terminal
    $ oc login -u user1
    ```

2. When prompted, enter the required information:

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Server [https://localhost:8443]: https://openshift.example.com:6443
    The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
    You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
    Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

    Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com:6443 (openshift)
    Username: user1
    Password:
    Login successful.

    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

        oc new-project <projectname>

    Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
    ```

    - For the `Server` prompt, enter the OpenShift Container Platform server URL.
    - For the `Use insecure connections?` prompt, enter whether to use insecure connections.
    - For the `Username` prompt, enter the username to log in with.
    - For the `Password` prompt, enter the user’s password.

    !!! note

        If you are logged in to the web console, you can generate an `oc login` command that includes your token and server information. You can use the command to log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) without the interactive prompts. To generate the command, select **Copy login command** from the username drop-down menu at the top right of the web console.

    You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.

## Logging in to the OpenShift CLI using a web browser { #cli-logging-in-web_cli-developer-commands }

You can log in to the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) with the help of a web browser to access and manage your cluster. This allows you to avoid inserting your access token into the command line.

!!! warning

    Logging in to the CLI through the web browser runs a server on localhost with HTTP, not HTTPS; use with caution on multi-user workstations.

**Prerequisites**

- You must have access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
- You must have a browser installed.

**Procedure**

1. Enter the `oc login` command with the `--web` flag:

    ```terminal
    $ oc login <cluster_url> --web
    ```

    Optionally, you can specify the server URL and callback port. For example, `oc login <cluster_url> --web --callback-port 8280 localhost:8443`.

2. The web browser opens automatically. If it does not, click the link in the command output. If you do not specify the OpenShift Container Platform server `oc` tries to open the web console of the cluster specified in the current `oc` configuration file. If no `oc` configuration exists, `oc` prompts interactively for the server URL.

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Opening login URL in the default browser: https://openshift.example.com
    Opening in existing browser session.
    ```

3. If more than one identity provider is available, select your choice from the options provided.

4. Enter your username and password into the corresponding browser fields. After you are logged in, the browser displays the text `access token received successfully; please return to your terminal`.

5. Check the CLI for a login confirmation.

    ```terminal title="Example output"
    Login successful.

    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

        oc new-project <projectname>
    ```

    !!! note

        The web console defaults to the profile used in the previous session. To switch between Administrator and Developer profiles, log out of the OpenShift Container Platform web console and clear the cache.

    You can now create a project or issue other commands for managing your cluster.
