title: OpenShift Virtualization Architecture

# OpenShift Virtualization Architecture { #virt-architecture }

OpenShift Virtualization architecture consists of several Operators and components that manage the lifecycle, storage, networking, and scheduling of virtual machine workloads within the cluster.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys operator pods for each component of OpenShift Virtualization:

- Compute: `virt-operator`
- Storage: `cdi-operator`
- Network: `cluster-network-addons-operator`
- Scaling: `ssp-operator`

OLM also deploys the `hyperconverged-cluster-operator` pod, which is responsible for the deployment, configuration, and life cycle of other components, and several helper pods: `hco-webhook`, and `hyperconverged-cluster-cli-download`.

After all operator pods are successfully deployed, you should create the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). The configurations set in the `HyperConverged` CR serve as the single source of truth and the entrypoint for OpenShift Virtualization, and guide the behavior of the CRs.

The `HyperConverged` CR creates corresponding CRs for the operators of all other components within its reconciliation loop. Each operator then creates resources such as daemon sets, config maps, and additional components for the OpenShift Virtualization control plane. For example, when the HyperConverged Operator (HCO) creates the `KubeVirt` CR, the OpenShift Virtualization Operator reconciles it and creates additional resources such as `virt-controller`, `virt-handler`, and `virt-api`.

The OLM deploys the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator, but it is not functional until you create a `hostpath-provisioner` CR.

## About the HyperConverged Operator (HCO) { #virt-about-hco-operator_virt-architecture }

The HCO, `hco-operator`, provides a single entry point for deploying and managing OpenShift Virtualization and several helper operators with opinionated defaults. It also creates custom resources (CRs) for those operators.
