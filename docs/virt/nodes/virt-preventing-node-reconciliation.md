# Preventing node reconciliation { #virt-using-skip-node }

Use `skip-node` annotation to prevent the `node-labeller` from reconciling a node.

## Using skip-node annotation { #virt-using-skip-node_virt-preventing-node-reconciliation }

If you want the `node-labeller` to skip a node, annotate that node by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Prerequisites**

- You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

**Procedure**

- Annotate the node that you want to skip by running the following command:

    ```terminal
    $ oc annotate node <node_name> node-labeller.kubevirt.io/skip-node=true
    ```

    Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the relevant node to skip.

    Reconciliation resumes on the next cycle after the node annotation is removed or set to false.
